How to perform low-level IO with a USB flash drive under the BIOS (compared to a floppy)?,"i have recently been studying some bootstrap code which was intended for use with a floppy drive my goal is to modify the program so that it uses my usb flash drive now i see how the int 13h function has been used with the floppy device but i guess my question is how will communicating with the usb drive differ 
 for example here is a snippet of the floppy code gnu assembler
 
     movb    0x00dl        select 1st floppy 

     later 

    movw    seccx      get sector number 
    movw    headdx     get head number 

    movw    0x0201ax  read 1 sector 
    int 0x13
 
 
 now i have read that moving 0x80 into dl will select the first hdd in the bios in my particular bios i can change the drive order which would include a usb drive i am quite sure this is becoming bios dependant but i was thinking that the order listed in the bios could correspond to the value i move into dl i need to track down some documentation 
 i am really unfamiliar with working with block devices as it is can someone point me to a good place to start learning more 
 thanks

.NET Entity framework project layout (architecture),"im trying to determine how best to architect a net entity framework project to achieve a nice layered approach so far ive tried it out in a browsebased game where the players own and operate planets heres how ive got it 
 web site 
 this contains all the front end 
 c project  mlsgamedata   
 this contains the edmx file with all my data mappings not much else here 
 c project  mlsgamebusiness   
 this contains various classes that i call managers such as planetmanagercs  the planet manager has various static methods that are used to interact with the planet such as  getplanetint planetid  which would return an generated code object from mlsgamedata 
 from the website ill do something like this 
 var planet  planetmanagergetplanet1 
 it returns a  planet  object from from the mlsgamedata generated from the edmx it works but it bothers me to a degree because it means that my front end has to reference mlsgamedata ive always felt that the gui should only need to reference the business project though   
 in addition ive found that my manager classes tend to get very heavy ill end up with dozens of static methods in them 
 so my question is  how does everyone else lay out their asp ef projects 
 edit 
 after some more though theres additional items which bother me for example lets say i have my planet object which again is generated code from the wizard what if a time came that my planet needed to have a specialized property say population which is a calculation of some sort based on other properties of the planet object would i want to create a new class that inherits from planet and then return that instead hmm i wonder if those classes are sealed by the ef

Alternative to MS-Access/Excel for Spreadsheet Manipulation,"i have an msaccess application that formats the data in two large spreadsheets 20000 rows imports this data into tables runs a few queries comparing the data and outputs the results as excel files

cv::imshow sometimes is very slow,"ive got a problem with  cvimshow  it normally consumes about 12 ms processing time for my image size but at some point in my processingpipeline it uses 48 ms for the same kind of images 
 i have a method  
 void tooldisplayimage

   starttimemeasure
   cvimshowoutputimage
   evaluatetimemeasure

 
 image  is a member variable and the highgui window is created somewhere else 
time measurement works with  boostposixtime ptime  and  timeduration  
 cvstartwindowthread
 
 was called 
 the point is that if  displayimage  is called within a complex processing chain loading image from videofile some preprocessing etc  cvimshow  becomes very slow while a call in a paused video to redraw an updated image is very fast 
 if i add a  cvwaitkey10  before the time measurements beginning  cvimshow  becomes fast too so there might be some gui things which have to be processed which block  cvimshow   cvwaitkey40  is called in a separate thread in loop which waits for keyboard input to control eg pauseresume the video
as far as i know  cvimshow  is performed in some kind of queue which is processed during  cvwaitkey  times where can i find information about all the tasks which are performed during that times maybe i can rearrange some parts of my code really complex by now to allow faster  imshow  all the time 
 so what happens in a  cvimshow  call and what might be the reasons for the slowfast execution of the same call in different situations 
 edit  one difference i recognized between regular execution and processing in pause mode is that in pause mode the method is started from a bound mouse callback function thats from within the  windowthread  while in regular mode its started from the main processing thread

Need Better Algorithm for Finding Mapping Between 2 Sets of Points with Minimum Distance,"problem  i have two overlapping 2d shapes a and b each shape having the same number of pixels but differing in shape some portion of the shapes are overlapping and there are some pieces of each that are not overlapping my goal is to move all the nonoverlapping pixels in shape a to the nonoverlapping pixels in shape b since the number of pixels in each shape is the same i should be able to find a 1to1 mapping of pixels the restriction is that i want to find the mapping that minimizes the total distance traveled by all the pixels that moved 
 brute force  the brute force approach to solving this problem is obviously out of the question since i would have to compute the total distance of all possible mappings of which i think there are n where n is the number of nonoverlapping pixels in one shape times the computation of calculating a distance for each pair of points in the mapping n giving a total of o n  n  or something similar 
 backtracking  the only better solution i could think of was to use backtracking where i would keep track of the current minimum so far and at any point when im evaluating a certain mapping if i reach or exceed that minimum i move on to the next mapping even this wont do any better than o n  
 is there any way to solve this problem with a reasonable complexity 
 also note that the obvious approach of simply mapping a point to its closest matching neighbour does not always yield the optimum solution 
 simpler approach  as a secondary question if a feasible solution doesnt exist one possibility might be to partition each nonoverlapping section into small regions and map these regions greatly reducing the number of mappings to calculate the distance between two regions i would use the center of mass average of the pixel locations in the region however this presents the problem of how i should go about doing the partitioning in order to get a nearoptimal answer 
 any ideas are appreciated

Convert float to string in positional format (without scientific notation and false precision),"i want to print some floating point numbers so that theyre always written in decimal form eg  123450000000000000000000  or  0000000000000012345  not in  scientific notation  yet id want to the result to have the up to 157  significant figures  of a ieee 754 double and no more  
 what i want is  ideally  so that the result is the  shortest  string in positional decimal format that still results in the same value when converted to a  float  
 it is wellknown that the  repr  of a  float  is written in scientific notation if the exponent is greater than 15 or less than 4 
  n  0000000054321654321
 n
54321654321e08   scientific notation
 
 if  str  is used the resulting string again is in scientific notation 
  strn
54321654321e08
 
 
 it has been suggested that i can use  format  with  f  flag and sufficient precision to get rid of the scientific notation 
  format000000005 20f
000000005000000000000
 
 it works for that number though it has some extra trailing zeroes but then the same format fails for  1  which gives decimal digits beyond the actual machine precision of float 
  format01 20f
010000000000000000555
 
 and if my number is  45678e20  using  20f  would still lose relative precision 
  format45678e20 20f
000000000000000000005
 
 thus  these approaches do not match my requirements  
 
 this leads to the question what is the easiest and also wellperforming way to print arbitrary floating point number in decimal format having the same digits as in  reprn  or  strn  on python 3  but always using the decimal format not the scientific notation 
 that is a function or operation that for example converts the float value  000000005  to string  000000005   01  to  01   4200000000000000000  to  4200000000000000000  or  420000000000000000  and formats the float value  45678e5  as  0000045678  
 
 after the bounty period it seems that there are at least 2 viable approaches as karin demonstrated that using string manipulation one can achieve significant speed boost compared to my initial algorithm on python 2 
 thus 
 
 if performance is important and python 2 compatibility is required or if the  decimal  module cannot be used for some reason then  karins approach using string manipulation  is the way to do it 
 on python 3  my somewhat shorter code will also be faster  
 
 since i am primarily developing on python 3 i will accept my own answer and shall award karin the bounty

Deploying application with Python or another embedded scripting language,"im thinking about using python as an  embedded scripting language  in a hobby project written in  c  i would not like to depend on separately installed python distribution python documentation seems to be quite clear about general usage but i couldnt find a clear answer to this 
 is it feasible to deploy a python interpreter  standard library with my application would some other language like lua javascript spidermonkey ruby etc be better for this use 
 heres the criteria im weighing the different languages against 
 
 nofew dependencies on externally installed packages 
 standard library with good feature set 
 nice language  
 doesnt result in a huge install package

how do i deploy my own python library  standard library with the installer of my program so that it doesnt matter whether the platform already has python installed or not

How can I use Variadic templates to flatten a tree of types?,"i have a construct like this 
 templatetypename ts
struct list 

typedef listcharlistintfloatlistintunsigned charlistunsignedshort mylist
 
 and i want to essentially flatten it to one list what is the best way i think i could make something with recursion if i fiddle with it long enough but something tells me there should be a better way 
 what i want as a result of the above tree should be similar to this 
 typedef listcharintfloatintunsigned charunsignedshort flattenedlist
 
 here is my first attempt 
 templatetypename ts
struct list

templatetypename ts
struct flattentree
    typedef listts type

templatetypename ts typename us typename vs
struct flattentreetslistusvs
    typedef typename flattentreets us vstype type

 
 but it results in this error  error c3515 if an argument for a class template partial specialization is a pack expansion it shall be the last argument   
 rici pointed out  here  what msvc2013 is complaining about so no compiler bug here 
 § 14825 deducing template arguments from a type paragraph 5 lists the contexts in which template arguments cannot be deduced the relevant one is the last one in the list 
 — a function parameter pack that does not occur at the end of the parameterdeclarationclause
 
 update 
 i guess one could put in a dummy parameter at the very end keep moving the first argument to the end or expanding it to the front if its a list and specialize on the first parameter being my dummy to stop recursion that seems like a lot of work for the compiler just to flatten a list though

Web app deployment Best Practices : how to manage local & live files?,"i am writing php web applications and simply deploy them via ftp
to make it work i often have some tweakingdebugging to do given that i have little control over the free web server hosting me so whats working in my local environment might not work live 
 for example i keep a separate php file containing classdbmyappphp which extends a classdbphp with specific db parameters  db name username password which wont be the same local and live
for information  lately i started using git for version control 
 as my app evolves some files get renamed  deleted  created
when comes the time to upload a new version i have to either rely on my memory to know what i have to upload  delete or simply delete all  upload all but in the second case i need to avoid erasing the classdbmyappphp file 
 i havent come up with a proper solution to this 
 what are the best practices in this domain 
 i may have missed an existing discussion on this subject if so please point me to it

How to get faster code than numpy.dot for matrix multiplication?,"here  matrix multiplication using hdf5  i use hdf5 pytables for big matrix multiplication but i was suprised because using hdf5 it works even faster then using plain numpydot and store matrices in ram what is the reason of this behavior 
 and maybe there is some faster function for matrix multiplication in python because i still use numpydot for small block matrix multiplication 
 here is some code 
 assume matrices can fit in ram test on matrix 101000 x 1000 
 using default numpyi think no blas lib
plain numpy arrays are in ram time 948 
 if ab in ram c on disk time 148 
 if abc on disk time 37225 
 if i use numpy with mkl results are 015045435 
 results looks reasonable but i still dont understand why in 1st case block multiplication is fasterwhen we store ab in ram

VS Crashing after 'Set As StartUp Project',"i have a solution in vs 2012
i try to change the startup project to  specific  project but the vs crashing immediately with the other projects  no problem
with the familiar message visual studion stop working 
 i try also to define the startup project manualy in the suo file
see details in  why is set as startup option stored in the suo file and not the sln file 
but when i reopen the vs it crashes during the assemblies loading 
 any idea what can be the cause 
 edit 
 additional details 
 its solution contains also wcf project run in front of local iis this project run perfectly with the same code in other team computers
as result of the facts it seems an environment problem iis setting permissions and etc  
 note that i already reset vs setting and also repair the installation and the problem not resolved 
 maybe someone knows what the logical action of  set as startup project what the vs perform during the action except for the start point definition i think that the root of the problem hides there

Why isn't pass struct by reference a common optimization?,"up until today i had always thought that decent compilers automatically convert struct passbyvalue to passbyreference if the struct is large enough that the latter would be faster  to the best of my knowledge this seems like a nobrainer optimization  however to satisfy my curiosity as to whether this actually happens i created a simple test case in both c and  d  and looked at the output of both gcc and digital mars d  both insisted on passing 32byte structs by value when all the function in question did was add up the members and return the values with no modification of the struct passed in  the c version is below 
 include iostreamh

struct s 
    int i j k l m n o p


int foos s 
    return si  sj  sk  sl  sm  sn  so  sp


int main 
    s s
    int bar  foos
    cout  bar

 
 my question is why the heck wouldnt something like this be optimized by the compiler to passbyreference instead of actually pushing all those  int s onto the stack 
 note  compiler switches used  gcc o2 o3 inlined foo dmd o inline release 
 edit  obviously in the general case the semantics of passbyvalue vs passbyreference wont be the same such as if copy constructors are involved or the original struct is modified in the callee  however in a lot of realworld scenarios the semantics will be identical in terms of observable behavior  these are the cases im asking about

 so ofcourse i am not looking for complete guidelines for all the prerequisites and 3rd party applications i just need you folks help on figuring out on how exactly i can embed these  exe  and  msi  setups to be a part of my  wix  installation 
 also some are for  x64  and some are for  x86  so it should be capable enough to handle the os version and architecture how will this be accomplished with wix 
 i have been searching on internet for a while now and nothing concrete seems to be working for me 
 i need to make sure that if these applications are not installed then the software should also not install along with that if any of the prerequisite or 3rd party application is already installed then it should not install again 
 i guess this can be done using some wix tools but i am not able to get any concrete instructions on howto

 ok i have got the  microsoft net framework 4 x86 and x64  installed and the problem which i am facing now is i am unable to install  sql server compact 35 sp2  i am doing things one by one to make things more clear to me here under i am sharing my code so that you people can review

Why are authentication tokens considered stateless and sessions not?,"in the case of an authentication token the client sends the credentials receives a token and uses this in all subsequent calls the server needs to save the token in order to validate the requests 
 with for example php sessions the server returns a session uid which the client sends in every request the server needs to save the session 
 in both cases the server needs to save a state so why is the former considered stateless

Subclipse with SVNKit Adapter,"i have two questions and some context

"C#, Linq2SQL: Creating a predicate to find elements within a number of ranges","lets say i have something called stuff in my database with a property called id from the user i get a sequence of selected range objects or rather i create them from their input with the ids they want a stripped down version of that struct looks like this 
 public struct ranget  iequatableranget iequalitycomparerranget

    public t a
    public t b
    public ranget a t b
    
        a  a
        b  b
    
    

 
 so one could for example have gotten 
 var selectedrange  new listrangeint
    
        new range1 4
        new range711
    
 
 i then want to use that to create a predicate to select only things which have a value between those for example using the  predicatebuilder  i can for example do that this way 
 var predicate  predicatebuilderfalsestuff
foreach rangeint r in selectedrange

    int a  ra
    int b  rb
    predicate  predicateorø  øid  a  øid  b

 
 and then 
 var stuff  datacontextstuffswherepredicatetolist
 
 which works what i would like to do now is to create a generic extension method to create those predicates for me kind of like this 
 public static expressionfunctbool topredicatetthis ienumerablerangeint range funct int selector

    expressionfunct bool p  predicatebuilderfalset
    foreach rangeint r in range
    
        int a  ra
        int b  rb
        p  porø  selectorø  a  selectorø  b
    
    return p

 
 problem here is that it crashes with a notsupportedexception because of the selectorø call  method systemobject dynamicinvokesystemobject has no supported translation to sql 
 i guess that is understandable but is there any way to get around this what i would like to end up with is so that i could just do 
 var stuff  datacontextstuffswhereselectedrangetopredicatestuffø  øid
 
 or even better create something that returns an iqueryable so that i could just do 
 var stuff  datacontextstuffswherewithinstuffselectedrange ø  øid  possibly without having to specify stuff as type there
 
 so any ideas i would really like to get this working cause if not i will get a lot of those foreach blocks of code creating predicates 
 
 note 1  of course would be nice if i could expand to more than int like datetime and such but not sure how that ends up with using the  and  operators does compareto work with linqtosql if not there is no problem creating two one for int and one for datetime since that is mostly the types this will be used for 
 note 2  it is going to be used for reporting where the user is going to be able to narrow down what comes out based on different things like i want this report for those people and those dates

iOS 7 UIButtonBarItem image does not tint,"on my nav bar i have a couple of rightbarbuttonitems that have custom icons the icon images are white which worked well with the basic color scheme of ios 6

 this resulted trainds and validds being tokenized and of type  prefetchdataset  or  prefetchdataset shapes none none none 118 none none none types tfint32 tfint64  
 i then trained as follows but got a  large negative loss and an accuracy of 0

 if i dont do the fancy prefetch stuff  trainds  would be of type  batchdataset  or  batchdataset shapes none 118 none types tfint32 tfint64  but that also is getting me a negative loss and an accuracy of 0 
 and if i just do the following  
 x y  trainingtexttonumpy traininglabeltonumpy

 then  x  and  y  are of type  eagertensor  but i cant seem to figure out how to batch an  eagertensor  
 what types and shapes do i really need for  trainds  what am i missing or doing wrong

 they apparently didnt bother with tokenization with this dataset but i doubt tokenization is my issue why does their  traindatashuffle10000batch512  work but my  trainds  not work  
 its possible the issue is with the model setup the  embedding  layer or with tokenization but im not so sure thats the case ive already looked at the following tutorials for inspiration

"How to intercept a WKWebView request to detect which local resource files (css, js, png, ...) load together with a HTML file?","i have a html file which contains local resource files such as css js and png files inside its content these local resource files are in zip format my app use wkwebview to display this html file i want to find a solution to intercept the web view request to detect which local resource files are load together with this html file  then unzip them if they are still zip format 
 my html data content contains thousands of these local resource file so i cant unzip all of them before display content with uiwebview we are using nsurlprotocol subclass to intercept the request detect local resource files and unzip it on demand based on the html page which user is viewing  
 i am having this issue when convert uiwebview to wkwebview
similar problem was post here  httpsforumsdeveloperapplecomthread87474

 2 convert file scheme to the custom scheme xfile then load it with wkwebview

         your local resource files will be catch here you can determine it by checking the urlschemetaskrequesturl

 consolelogname name is a string 
 i get this in visual studio 
 
 it honestly doesnt help that im very new to typescript as well so that also comes into play with me having difficulty learning aws cdk but still im loving it so far 
 i already have the  console  node module installed in the cdk app project folder  nodemodules  right here 
 
 any help would be greatly appreciated 
 thanks so much in advance

"How to get service reference to generate correctly with message contracts based on 3rd party WSDL, or force no message contracts in WF Service project","i have a problem that given 3rd party wsdl i am able from a console app to easily create a service proxy that works but from a wf4 wf service i am not the generated proxy in the latter case is clearly buggy involving specifically 2 problems
a message contracts always generated when not requested or needed
b incorrect response messages and xml wrapper names used resulting in null response objects and failed deserialization 
 the problem i am facing is in the actual generation of the referencecs class on the basis of 3rd party wsdl in the wsdl there are many operations and in order of appearance 2 of them are as so 
  operation namepu013
      documentation
        descriptioncheckresponse servicedescription

        helpthis service cut outhelp
      documentation
      input messagetnsmi102request 
      output messagetnssimpleresponse 
    operation 
 
 what this results in in the referencecs is the following c 
 workflowservice1psepu013response pu013workflowservice1psepu013request request



workflowservice1psepu013response mi102workflowservice1psemi102request request 
 
 note that for some reason the mi102 operation is generated with the incorrect response message of pu013response which is declared as this 
  systemdiagnosticsdebuggerstepthroughattribute
    systemcodedomcompilergeneratedcodeattributesystemservicemodel 4000
    systemservicemodelmessagecontractattributewrappernamepu013response wrappernamespacehttppse iswrappedtrue
    public partial class pu013response  
 
 note the wrappername prevents the xml serializer from recognising the response which is mi102response so for all operations that are not pu013 i always get a null response 
 also this does not occur if i add a reference from a console application this does not generate message contracts and in this case invocation and response work 
 what is different is svcutil being invoke behind the scenes if so what is different about the parameters used can svcutil be used to generate the xamlx activities too so that i might find a command line workaround 
 this looks like a vs  add service reference bug the alternative is to manually correct many operations in the referencecs 
 ideally i am looking for a way to easily automatically run svcutil or add service reference so that the reference class is correct and the xamlx activities generated a nice to have is an explanation of why there is a difference and behind the scenes what is happening 
 update 
message contracts generated in the console app result in the same problem  incorrect response declarations the problem goes away if parameters are used instead of messages which are not available from a wf service app

Breeze compatible JavaScript GUI frameworks,"while i already posted a similar question   breeze compatible spa building  and likely started something good going between ideablade and telerik as a consequence i believe that breeze deserves a lot wider recognition because of its unique approach to access entity framework on the server side so it seems pretty obvious to me that even notoriously complete js frameworks like  sencha  or  wakanda   need to ensure to work with breeze  
 the current issues between kendoui and breeze are very clearly described in the post by remco blok at  httpwwwkendouicomblogsteamblogposts130221breezejsandthekendouidatasourceaspx  stated succinctly the integration with breeze should be made at the level of entities  not json data which is the way almost everyone handles the transactions between a js client and sql server  
 wakanda is a great example of a very rich development environment with elaborate gui builder debugger etc that unfortunately cannot be used with legacy data on the server side 
 as far as i know breeze works just fine with angular but angular needs angularui  httpangularuigithubio  which in turn is not as complete as i would like it to be and has some jquery dependencies that may cause collisions pretty soon breeze will work with kendoui afaik  does anyone know about some other collection of javascript frameworks that all together would offer the level of ease that visual studio provides for windows desktop applications creation after all javascript applications are desktop application with the distribution problem solved in a very elegant fashion

 now i have noted a problem when one of the parameters contain nonascii charterers such as  £   ¬  etc  
 now the final query will have any nonascii characters such as  £  encoded wrongly as  u00a3  i read about this problem and seems i can replace  
 urlquery  querytostring
 
 with 
 urlquery  riescapeuristringhttputilityurldecodequerytostring    
 
 now using the later approach will encode  £  as  c2a3  which is the correct encoded value 
 but the problem i am facing with  urlquery  uriescapeuristringhttputilityurldecodequerytostring  in that case one of the parameters contains    then the url will have the following format    operationaddassetassetname  so it will assume that i am passing empty assetname  parameter not value

 let me summarize my problem again i want to be able to pass the following 3 things inside my url to a third part api  
 
 standard characters such as ab a b 1 2 3  
 nonascii characters such as  £  ¬

    string xml  clientdownloadstringurltostring
    xmldocument doc  new xmldocument

 in this approach i can pass values such as       since they are going to be url encoded but if i want to pass nonascii characters they will be encoded using iso88591  so if i have  £  value  my above code will encoded as  u00a3  and it will be saved inside the 3rd party api as  u00a3  instead of  £  
 approach b  
 i use  
 urlquery  uriescapeuristringhttputilityurldecodequerytostring 
 
 instead of 
 urlquery  querytostring
 
 now i can pass nonascii characters such as  £  since they will be encoded correctly using utf8 instead of iso88591 but i can not pass values such as    because my url will be read wrongly by the 3rd party api for example if i want to pass  assetname  my url will look as follow 
 operationaddassetname
 
 so the third part api will assume i am passing empty  assetname  while i am trying to pass its value as

How to suppress Java compiler warnings for specific functions,"we are always taught to make sure we use a  break  in switch statements to avoid fallthrough

 however the compiler spits out massive amounts of warnings that may obscure warnings that i need to know about i know how i can change the compiler to ignore all fallthrough warnings but i would like to implement this on a methodbymethod basis to avoid missing a place where i did not intend for fallthrough to happen

How do I call a database function using SQLAlchemy in Flask?,"i want to call a function that i created in my postgresql database ive looked at the official sqlalchemy documentation as well as several questions here on so but nobody seems to explain how to set up the function in sqlalchemy 
 i did find  this question  but am unsure how to compile the function as the answer suggests where does that code go i get errors when i try to put this in both my view and model scripts 
 edit 1 8112016 
 as per the communitys requests and requirements here are all the details i left out 
 i have a table called books whose columns are arranged with information regarding the general book title authors publication date 
 i then have many tables all of the same kind whose columns contain information regarding all the chapters in each book chapter name length short summary  it is absolutely necessary for each book to have its own table  i have played around with one large table of all the chapters and found it ill suited to my needs not too mention extremely unwieldy  
 my function that im asking about queries the table of books for an individual books name and casts the books name to a regclass it then queries the regclass object for all its data returns all the rows as a table like the individual book tables and exits heres the raw code 
 create or replace function publicgetbookbookname character varying
 returns tablecolumns of individual book table go here
 language plpgsql
as function
declare
    tbl regclass
begin
    for tbl in
        select nameregclass
        from books
        where namebookname
    loop
        return query execute 
        select  from  tbl
    end loop
end
function
 
 this function has been tested several times in both the command line and pgadmin it works as expected 
 my intention is to have a view in my flask app whose route is  approutebookstringbookname  and calls the above function before rendering the template the exact view is as follows 
 approutebookstringbookname
def bookbookname
  chapterlist  call function here
  return rendertemplatebookhtml bookbookname listchapterlist
 
 this is my question how do i set up my app in such a way that sqlalchemy knows about and can call the function i have in my database i am open to other suggestions of achieving the same result as well

Serving Python (Flask) REST API over HTTP2,"i have a python rest service and i want to serve it using http2 my current server setup is  nginx  gunicorn  in other words nginx port 443 and 80 that redirects to port 443 is running as a reverse proxy and forwards requests to gunicorn port 8000 no ssl nginx is running in http2 mode and i can verify that by using chrome and inspecting the protocol column after sending a simple get to the server however gunicorn reports that the requests it receives are http10 also i coulntt find it in this list
 httpsgithubcomhttp2http2specwikiimplementations 
so my questions are 
 
 is it possible to serve a python flask application with http2 if yes which servers support it 
 in my case one reverse proxy server and one serving the actual api which server has to support http2 
 
 the reason i want to use http2 is because in some cases i need to perform thousands of requests all together and i was interested to see if the multiplexed requests feature of http2 can speed things up with http10 and python requests as the client each request takes 80ms which is unacceptable the other solution would be to just bulkbatch my rest resources and send multiple with a single requests yes this idea sounds just fine but i am really interested to see if http2 could speed things up 
 finally i should mention that for the client side i use python requests with the hyper http2 adapter

Is glibc's implementation of fprintf() thread-safe?,"is fprintf threadsafe   the glibc manual  seems to say it is but my application which writes to a file using single call to fprintf seems to be intermingling partial writes from different processes 
 edit to clarify the program in question is a  lighttpd  plugin and the server is running with multiple worker threads 
 looking at the file some of the writes are intermingled 
 edit 2 it seems the problem im seeing might be due to lighttpds worker threads actually being separate processes  httpredminelighttpdnetwikilighttpddocsmultiprocessor

How to get id of newly inserted record using Excel VBA?,"seems a common enough problem this but most solutions refer to concatenating multiple sql commands something which i believe cant be done with adovba ill be glad to be shown wrong in this regard however 
 i currently insert my new record then run a select query using i hope enough fields to guarantee that only the newly inserted record can be returned  my databases are rarely accessed by more than one person at a time negligible risk of another insert happening between queries and due to the structure of the tables identifying the new record is normally pretty easy 
 im now trying to update a table that does not have much scope for uniqueness other than in the artificial primary key  this means there is a risk that the new record may not be unique and im loathe to add a field just to force uniqueness 
 whats the best way to insert a record into an access table then query the new primary key from excel in this situation

 when i do  catgetkittensaddnewkitten  the order by name will be broken  
 is it possible to let hibernate do the work of keeping the collection always ordered by using the  sort hibernate  annotation 
sort has the disadvantage that it forces you to implement comparable interface 
what would be the right pure jpa way to do that saving everything to db and reloading it
makes it sense to combine orderby and sort 
 update 
solution up to now is to combine orderby and sort orderby leads to a  order by  clause in the generated sql which is better for performance i assume that java is sorting again on inserting into the sorted container but that should be much faster because the elements are already sorted
sort together with an implemented  comparable  interface leads to a always sorted container note that i use now  sortedset  instead of  list  here the updated code

SSL session persistence and secure cookies,"i currently have a rollyourown application security service that runs in my enterprise and is  for the most part  meeting business needs 
 the issue that i currently face is that the service has traditionally naively relied on the users source ip remaining constant as a hedge against session hijacking  the web applications in the enterprise are not directly available to the public and it was in the past perfectly acceptable for me to require that a users address remain constant throughout a given session 
 unfortunately this is no longer the case and i am therefore forced to switch to a solution that does not rely on the source ip i would much prefer to implement a solution that actually accomplishes the original designers intent ie preventing session hijacking 
 my research so far has turned up  this  which essentially says salt your authentication token hash with the ssl session key 
 on the face of it this seems like a perfect solution however i am left with a nagging suspicion that realworld implementation of this scheme is impractical due to the possibility that the client and server can at any time  effectively arbitrarily  opt to renegotiate the ssl session and therefore change the key  
 this is the scenario i am envisioning 
 
 ssl session established and key agreed upon 
 client authenticates to server at the application level ie via username and password 
 server writes a secure cookie that includes ssl session key 
 something  occurs that causes a session renegotiation for example i think ie does this on a timer with or without a reason 
 client submits a request to the server containing the  old  session key since there was no application level knowledge of the renegotiation there was no opportunity for a new updated hash to be written to the client 
 server rejects clients credential due to hash match failure etc 
 
 is this a real issue or is this a misapprehension on my part due to a to say the least lessthanperfect understanding of how ssl works

Static methods vs instance methods in C#,"for an application i am writing i want to have extreme extensibility and extension methods seem to give me what i want plus the ability to call them without an instance which i need too

 which can have an instance distance method so like 
 thisdistance person p
 
 this is great but this doesnt give me the ability to calculate the distance between 2 points say point3 without creating instances of the person class 
 what i want to do is this 
 class person no distance methods
 
 but extension methods of distance 
 distance this person person
distance this point3 point3
 
 this way i can both do

How to configure and enable Azure Service Fabric Reverse Proxy for an existing on-premises cluster?,"is the azure service fabric reverse proxy available in an onpremises cluster if so how can i enable it for an existing cluster 
 the service fabric reverse proxy is described  here  it allows clients external to the cluster to access application services by name with a special url  without needing to know the exact hostport on which an instance of the service is running which may change as services are automatically moved around   
 by default the service fabric reverse proxy does not appear to be enabled for my onprem cluster with two instances of a stateless service i tried using the  documented  port 19008 but could not reach the service using the recommended uri syntax 
 to wit this works  
 httpfqdn20001apiodatav1metadata
 
 but this does not  
 httpfqdn19008myappmyserviceapiodatav1metadata
 
 in the nodetypes section of the clusterconfig json used to set up my onprem cluster there is a property httpgatewayendpointport 19080 but that port does not appear to work as a reverse proxy it is the service fabric explorer webapp endpoint i am guessing that the needed configuration is specified somehow in the cluster config json there are instructions in the  referenced article  that explain how to configure the reverse proxy in the cloud but not onpremises 
 what i am looking for are instructions on how to set up the service fabric reverse proxy in an onpremises multimachine cluster or dev cluster

Delegate.CreateDelegate vs DynamicMethod vs Expression,"questions about  making reflection fly and exploring delegates  
 if i need to create delegates  funct tresult  to methods on dynamically loaded types i could potentially use 1  delegatecreatedelegate  2  dynamicmethod  3  expression  trees 
 lets say the set of dynamically loaded typesmethods are reflected once at application startup via config and used throughout the lifetime of the app startup performance is not an issue and neither is memory the delegates are cached and dispatched to in a stronglytyped way these delegates are hot paths accessed concurrently 
 which dynamic binding method would you prefer and why

 i want to sort them out in the ascending order of the dates based on the month day and year whats the best way to do that 
 originally the emails are being fetched in the mysql date format so its possible for me to get the array in this state 
 array

    20080228some text
    20080306some text

 
 perhaps when its in this format i can loop through them remove all the    hyphen marks so they are left as integars sort them using  arraysort  and loop through them yet again to sort them would prefer if there was another way as id be doing 3 loops with this per user 
 thanks 
 edit i could also do this

PhoneGap Build Plugins not functioning,"i am building a phonegap build app and i will be requiring some plugins i have followed the docs yet none are working since none of them are working i suppose its a common problem heres the plugins in the  configxml  file 
  plugins   
gapplugin nameorgapachecordovadevice   device plugin   
gapplugin namecomphonegappluginstatusbar   status bar plugin   
gapplugin namecomversocordovaclipboard   clipboard plugin   
gapplugin namecomchariotsolutionscordovapluginkeyboardtoolbarremover   keyboard toolbar removal plugin   
gapplugin nameorgapachecordovasplashscreen   splashscreen plugin   
gapplugin nameorgapachecordovavibration   vibration plugin 
 
 heres the links in the  indexhtml  file if theres a problem my best guess is that it will be here 
  phonegap build   
script srcphonegapjsscript  
script srcdevicejsscript  
script srcstatusbarjsscript  
script srcclipboardjsscript  
script srckeyboardtoolbarremoverjsscript  
script srcsplashscreenjsscript  
script srcvibrationjsscript
 
 none are working except the device plugin firing the deviceready event 
 heres some code from the javascript file 
 documentaddeventlistenerdeviceready functione   
    hiding the status bar as even the fullscreen preference in configxml isnt working
    statusbarhide  
    windowsettimeoutfunction    
         trying to hide the splash screen which also doesnt work or even show properly from configxml
        navigatorsplashscreenhide  
     4000 
 false  
 
 i tested this function with an alert and i can assure you that it does get called heres some more 
  this is for the clipboard plugin  
function handlecopyandpaste   
    copybuttonclickfunction   
        windowpluginsclipboardcopyresultval  
      
    pastebuttonclickfunction   
        windowpluginsclipboardpastefunction text    
            convertthisvaltext  
            convert  
          
      
 
 
 this is for vibrations 
 navigatornotificationvibrate2500
 
 this is for hiding the keyboard toolbar once an input field called  convertthis  has  focus  
 convertthisfocusfunction 
    toolbarhide

 
 i tried removing the js links in  indexhtml  yet still nothing i also tried putting the plugin tags outside the widget tag in  configxml  and nothing weirdly enough the plugins tab in phonegap build dashboards says none are installed 
 
 source  uzusoftcom

Cannot use old NDK (android-ndk-r17c) after Catalina upgrade due to new security,"after upgrading to macos catalina my project wont build anymore this is due to catalina believing the binaries in androidndkr17c to not be from a trusted developer 
 you get messages such as 
“ld” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified
macos cannot verify that this app is free from malware 
 i have to use the old ndk due to problems with native opencv library sdk and newer ndks they are working on it but the newer sdk is not stable enough for me yet 
 i was able to get around clang and clang not being able to work by going to the security pane and clicking allow anyway on the security alerts however when trying this with id i can get past the first warning by clicking allow anyway but it seems to be called subsequently and on the subsequent call i do not have the option to allow it to open 
 there is no code really i just have and have had for a long time android studio ndk reference pointing to the old ndk via the config  
 in ide from ndk it fails to load id

Should thread-safe class have a memory barrier at the end of its constructor?,"when implementing a class intended to be threadsafe should i include a memory barrier at the end of its constructor in order to ensure that any internal structures have completed being initialized before they can be accessed or is it the responsibility of the consumer to insert the memory barrier before making the instance available to other threads 
 simplified question  
 is there a race hazard in the code below that could give erroneous behaviour due to the lack of a memory barrier between the initialization and the access of the threadsafe class or should the threadsafe class itself protect against this 
 concurrentqueueint queue  null

parallelinvoke
      queue  new concurrentqueueint
      queueenqueue5
 
 note that it is acceptable for the program to enqueue nothing as would happen if the second delegate executes before the first the nullconditional operator    protects against a  nullreferenceexception  here however it should not be acceptable for the program to throw an  indexoutofrangeexception   nullreferenceexception  enqueue  5  multiple times get stuck in an infinite loop or do any of the other weird things caused by race hazards on internal structures 
 elaborated question  
 concretely imagine that i were implementing a simple threadsafe wrapper for a queue im aware that net already provides  concurrentqueuet  this is just an example i could write 
 public class threadsafequeuet

    private readonly queuet queue

    public threadsafequeue
    
        queue  new queuet

         threadmemorybarrier  is this line required
    

    public void enqueuet item
    
        lock queue
        
            queueenqueueitem
        
    

    public bool trydequeueout t item
    
        lock queue
        
            if queuecount  0
            
                item  defaultt
                return false
            

            item  queuedequeue
            return true
        
    

 
 this implementation is threadsafe once initialized however if the initialization itself is raced by another consumer thread then race hazards could arise whereby the latter thread would access the instance before the internal  queuet  has been initialized as a contrived example 
 threadsafequeueint queue  null

parallelfor0 10000 i 

    if i  0
        queue  new threadsafequeueint
    else if i  2  0
        queueenqueuei
    else
    
        int item  1
        if queuetrydequeueout item  true
            consolewritelineitem
    

 
 it is acceptable for the code above to miss some numbers however without the memory barrier it could also be getting a  nullreferenceexception  or some other weird result due to the internal  queuet  not having been initialized by the time that  enqueue  or  trydequeue  are called 
 is it the responsibility of the threadsafe class to include a memory barrier at the end of its constructor or is it the consumer who should include a memory barrier between the classs instantiation and its visibility to other threads what is the convention in the net framework for classes marked as threadsafe 
 edit  this is an advanced threading topic so i understand the confusion in some of the comments an instance  can  appear as halfbaked if accessed from other threads without proper synchronization this topic is discussed extensively within the context of doublechecked locking which is broken under the ecma cli specification without the use of memory barriers such as through  volatile  per  jon skeet  
 
 the java memory model doesnt ensure that the constructor completes before the reference to the new object is assigned to instance  the java memory model underwent a reworking for version 15 but doublecheck locking is still broken after this without a volatile variable  as in c  
 without any memory barriers its broken in the ecma cli specification too its possible that under the net 20 memory model which is stronger than the ecma spec its safe but id rather not rely on those stronger semantics especially if theres any doubt as to the safety

Kappa architecture: when insert to batch/analytic serving layer happens,"as you know kappa architecture is some kind of simplification of lambda architecture kappa doesnt need batch layer instead speed layer have to guarantee computation precision and enough throughput more parallelismresources on historical data recomputation 
 still kappa architecture requires two serving layers in case when you need to do analytic based on historical data for example data that have age  2 weeks are stored at redis streaming serving layer while all older data are stored somewhere at hbase batch serving layer 
 when due to kappa architecture i have to insert data to batch serving layer  
if streaming layer inserts data immidiately to both batch  stream serving layers  than how about late data arrival or streaming layer should backup speed serving layer to batch serving layer on regular basis 
 
 example let say source of data is kafka data are processed by spark structured streaming or flink sinks are redis and hbase when write to redis  hbase should happen

What is the difference between using the '@patch.object' and 'with patch.object' in Python?,"in writing unit tests for my application i have always been using the  mockpatch  and  patchobject  decorators but now for some unit tests when i use the decorator i receive an error  typeerror staticmethod object is not an iterator  
 but with the same code if i use  mockpatchobject  or  mockpatchobject  everything works just fine 
 for example in my test class i have this method 
 staticmethod
def mymock
   do something
 
 when i try the following unit test 
 mockpatchmypackagemymodulemymethod sideeffectmymock
def testsomethingself mymethodmocked
    test something
 
 i receive the error message stated before  typeerror staticmethod object is not an iterator  
 but when i try this way 
 def testsomethingself
    with patchobjectmymodule mymethod as mockedmethod
        mockedmethodsideeffect  selfmymock
        test something
 
 then everything works perfectly 
 ive read the python documentation about mock and unit tests but i couldnt find any explanation for this behavior  
 what is the difference between using the  decorator pattern  and the  with  pattern where i can find more about this 
 just to be more clear this my code structure

    staticmethod
    def mymock

How are interrupts handled by dual processor machines?,"i have an idea of how interrupts are handled by a dual core cpu  i was wondering about how interrupt handling is implemented on a board with more than one physical processor  
 is any of the interrupt responsibility determined by the physical boards configuration  each processor must be able to handle some types of interrupts like disk io  unless there is some circuitry to manage and dispatch interrupts to the appropriate processor  my guess is that the scheme must be processor neutral so that any processor and core can run the interrupt handler 
 if a core is waiting on a disk read will that core be the one to run the interrupt handler when the disk is ready

    for ulong power  1 power  0 power  power  1
    
         this for loop used shifting for powers of 2 meaning
         that the value will become 0 after the last shift
         from binary 10000000 to 00000000 then the for
         loop will break out

            return true
        if power  number

    return false

 
 but then i thought how about checking if log 2  x is an exactly a round number when i checked for 2631  mathlog  returned exactly 63 because of rounding so i checked if 2 to the power 63 is equal to the original number and it is because the calculation is done in  double s and not in exact numbers

Why is std::vector contiguous?,"besides the fact that the standard defines it to be contiguous why is stdvector contiguous 
 if it runs out of space it needs to reallocate a new block and copy the old block to the new one before continuing 
 what if it wasnt contiguous when the storage fills up it would just allocate a new block and keep the old block when accessing through an iterator it would do simple   checks to see which block the index is in and return it this way it doesnt need to copy the array every time it runs out of space 
 would this really workbe better or am i missing something

Is a finally block without a catch block a java anti-pattern?,"i just had a pretty painful troubleshooting experience in troubleshooting some code that looked like this 
 try 
   dosomestuff
   domore
 finally 
   dosomeotherstuff

 
 the problem was difficult to troubleshoot because dosomestuff threw an exception which in turn caused dosomeotherstuff to also throw an exception  the second exception thrown by the finally block was thrown up to my code but it did not have a handle on the first exception thrown from dosomestuff which was the real rootcause of the problem 
 if the code had said this instead the problem would have been readily apparent 
 try 
    dosomestuff
    domore
 catch exception e 
    logerrore
 finally 
   dosomeotherstuff

 
 so my question is this 
 is a finally block used without any catch block a wellknown java antipattern  it certainly seems to be a notreadilyapparent subclass of the obviously wellknown antipattern dont gobble exceptions

How can I recursively copy a directory into another and replace only the files that have not changed?,"i am looking to do a specific copy in fedora  
 i have two folders 
 
 webroot holding all web filesimages etc 
 export folder containing thousands of php css js documents that are exported from my svn repo 
 
 the export directory contains many of the same filesfolders that the root does however the root contains additional ones not found in export 
 id like to merge all of the contents of export with my webroot with the following options 
 
 overwriting the file in webroot if exports version contains different code than what
is inside of webroots version live 
 preserve the permissionsusersgroups of the file if it is overwritten the export
version replacing the live version note i would like the webroots permissionsownership maintained but with exports contents 
 no promptingstopping of the copy
of any kind ie not verbose 
 recursive copy  obviously i
would like to copy all files
folders and subfolders found in
export 
 
 ive done a bit of research into cp  would this do the job  
 cp pruf export pathtowebroot

iPhone Dev: Xcode debugger does not stop on breakpoints,"ive got xcode 312 on os x 1055 i have an iphone project that builds fine but the debugger will not hit any of the breakpoints i set ive tried all the standard fixes that i find on the net 
 
 ive turned off load symbols lazily in xcode preferences 
 my active config is debug 
 optimization level is 0 in build settings 
 ive cleaned all targets and rebuilt 
 i use build and debug as opposed to build and run 
 
 i thought i might have inadvertently tweaked settings on my project so i created a new project and that one has the same problem 
 im hoping that i am missing something easy here my debugger was working just a few days back but all of a sudden it has stopped 
 
 update 
 things are just getting stranger  here are some answers to the responses 
 
 i cannot find gcc 40  code generation options anywhere  ive looked hi and low in both target and executable info pages  the only option i see is to select the compiler version and gcc 40 is selected but that is a oneline section with no additional options 
 about where to put breakpoints my only breakpoint for now is in main and it is not being hit 
 i am starting the debugger with the run  debug  y command still no luck 
 
 
 update 2 
 
 changed base sdk in target settings to sim 221  changed active sdk to sim 221 
 now i can see gcc 40 code generation options  debug symbols are checked 
 still does not hit breakpoints 
 
 here is the console log breakpoint set at first line of mainm

Command line command to auto-kill a command after a certain amount of time,"id like to automatically kill a command after a certain amount of time  i have in mind an interface like this 
  constrain 300 foo args
 
 which would run foo with args but automatically kill it if its still running after 5 minutes 
 it might be useful to generalize the idea to other constraints such as autokilling a process if it uses too much memory 
 are there any existing tools that do that or has anyone written such a thing 
 added jonathans solution is precisely what i had in mind and it works like a charm on linux but i cant get it to work on mac osx  i got rid of the sigrtmin which lets it compile fine but the signal just doesnt get sent to the child process  anyone know how to make this work on mac 
 added note that an update is available from jonathan that works on mac and elsewhere

search and replace with regex to increment numbers in Visual Studio Code,"im currently working on a big svg sprite
the diffrent images are always 2000px apart 
 what i have is 
 g transformtranslate00
g transformtranslate02000
g transformtranslate04000
 
 after regex want this so just adding 2000 onto the second number 
 g transformtranslate02000
g transformtranslate04000
g transformtranslate06000
 
 i have the issue now that some new images have to be put at the top of the document thus meaning i would need to change all numbers and they are quite alot 
 i was thinking about using regular expressions and even found out that it works in the search bar of vs code the thing is i never worked with any regex and im kinda confused 
 could someone give me a solution and an explanation for incrementing all the sample numbers by 2000
i hope i understand it afterwards so i can get my foot into that topic
im also happy with just links to tutorials in general or my specific use case 
 thank you very much

Namespaced models in Rails: What's the state of the union?,"since the beginning rails has had issues with namespaced models as time went on pretty much everybody gave up on using it myself included 
 with rails 23 out id like an update on the situation specifics questions i have in mind are 
 
 first off is it good to go 
 table naming what rule to follow 
 associations how to declare them with the least verbosity how to name foreign key columns 
 autorequiring does it work if you put the model files in a subdir matching the namespace or how to name and where to place the files 
 generation does the model generator handles namespaces successfully and correctly

What is the performance cost of assigning a single string value using +'s,"i have often wondered this is there a performance cost of splitting a string over multiple lines to increase readability when initially assigning a value to a string i know that strings are immutable and therefore a new string needs to be created every time also the performance cost is actually irrelevant thanks to todays really fast hardware unless you are in some diabolical loop so for example 
 string newstring  this is a really long long long long long 
     long long long long long long long long long long long long  
     long long long long long long long long long string for example
 
 how does the jvm or nets compiler and other optimizations handle this will it create a single string or will it create 1 string then a new concatenating the value and then another one concatenating the values again 
 this is for my own curiosity

"UIScrollView with centered UIImageView, like Photos app","i would like to have scroll view with an image content view the image is actually map which is much bigger than the screen the map should be initially in the center of the scroll view like photos in photos app when you turn iphone to landscape orientation 
 
 i did not manage to have the map in the center with correct zooming and scrolling at the same time
provided that the map image starts from the top of the screen in portrait orientation the code looks something like 
  voidloadview 
    mapview  uiimageview alloc initwithimageuiimage imagenamedmapjpg
    cgfloat mapheight  mapheight  screenwidth  mapwidth

    scrollviewminimumzoomscale  1
    scrollview addsubviewmapview
    selfview  scrollview

 
 when i move the image frame to the center the image grows only from the top of its frame down i tried to play around with mapview transform with dynamically changing frame of the imageview nothing works for me so far

Migrating from eclipse + SVN to Android Studio,"we currently use eclipse for android development  and our projects are synchronized to an svn  
 current structure  
 
 android application 1 
 android application 2 
 android library 1 
 android library 2 
 
 it is therefore independent projects on svn 
 details  
 android android app 1 need library 1
android android app 2 need library 1 and 2  etc  
 until then it is quite normal 
 the challenge is to move to the project structure in android studio  intellij  while ensuring compatibility with eclipse  so changing nothing in the current structure of svn  
 and i just cant handle how to do this with the intellij structure projects modules    
 in addition there appears to have a problem with android studio it is impossible for me to import module  i can create one but not import one 
 and thats not all  in open module settings  only android sdk appears for each project so i can not handle modules  
 i tried to import each project one by one with a checkout from subversion it works but how to link projects to each other then  i end up with a project structure as in eclipse and i guess that is not good 
 in android studio a module is dependent on a project right  but i do not want a library dependent of any project 
 please do not hesitate to ask any information im sure that i didnt say everything because i try that from 2 days now so ive try many many things i just cant get it 
 whats wrong   
 thanks a lot

Background-color hex to JavaScript variable,"im kind of new to javascript and jquery and now im facing a problem 
 i need to post some data to php and one bit of the data needs to be the background color hex of div x

 the css function seems to return a string like this rgb0 70 255  
 i couldnt find any way to get hex of the backgroundcolor even though its set as hex in css 
 so it seems like i need to convert it i found a function for converting rgb to hex but it needs to be called with three different variables r g and b so i would need to parse the string rgbxxxxxx into var rx var gxx var bxxx somehow

An Overview of Nix/OS Architecture?,"while the nixos wiki and manuals provide a lot of excellent information i am still having trouble getting an architectural overview apologies for the quantity and naivity of the questions feel free to answer a subset 
 
 1 what constitutes a nix package 
 from my reading of the manual a nix package is 
     i a nix expression that fetches the source and dependencies needed to build 
     ii a  builder  script 
     iii a listing on  allpackagesnix  
 the source and the binary along with generated derivations are put in the  nixstore  and channels automate updates keeping them up to date efficiently by using a shared binary cache 
     a is this correct and complete 
     b where are the nix expressions stored 
     c may i simply copy a package folders between the  nixstore s of different machines if they have the same architecture 
 
 2 what constitutes a nix environment 
     a where and how are environments defined 
     b what about user profiles 
     c how does the  nixshell  command work is it related to the  nixenv  command 
 
 3 what is the relationship between nixoss  configurationnix  and nix environments 
 from the manual and wiki i gather nixos is a nix package and that nix creates a basic system environment based on  configurationnix  
     a is this true and if so what do  nixosrebuild  and  nixosinstall  do besides this 
     b is it possible to reverse the process ie generate succinct package or configuration files from an environment 
     c what can i do with nixos that i cannot do with nix 
 
 4 what are best practices when using nix for creating portable and reproducible environments to share with colleagues 
     a what are the various approaches to sharing desktop server and development environments 
     b what are the usecases for these approaches 
     c what are their advantages and disadvantages visàvis portability and accesibility

 i have developed the macro on my own computer where i have excel 2007 and for me the code works perfectly fine my friend uses excel 2013 and apparently there seems to be a major difference on how those 2 versions deal with the image importing and saving 
 overall i found 2 different ways how to insert images the first one i tried was something similar to this

 in the documentation for this 2nd approach it is said that the 3rd paramenter which is true here is responsible for saving the picture with the document

mmap vs O_DIRECT for random reads (what are the buffers involved?),"i am implementing a disk based hashtable supporting large amount of keys 26 million the value is deserialized reads are essentially random throughout the file values are less than the page size and i am optimising for ssds safetyconsistency are not such huge issues performance matters 
 my current solution involves using a  mmap  file with  madvrandom  madvdontneed  set to disable prefetching by the kernel and only load data as needed ondemand 
 i get the idea that the kernel reads from disk to memory buffer and i deserialize from there 
 what about  odirect  if i call  read  im still copying into a buffer which i deserialize from so can i gain any advantage 
 where can i find more info on the buffers involved with a  mmap  file and calling  read  on a file opened with  odirect  
 i am not interested in read ahead or caching it has nothing to offer for my use case

Are Google Chrome and Chromium equivalent for web design/development?,"this is probably a silly question however from a web designdevelopment point of view i mean support for web standards and web technologies could google chrome and chromium be considered equivalent 
 i know that they are essentially the same browser the former being the branded version of the latter but they also have some functional differences and google chrome features some additions not present in the base chromium browser detailed on the  chromium page  on wikipedia 
 they use the blink engine which is in turn also used by other chromiumbased browsers like ms edge and opera and all these browsers have an uneven support for many different web technologies as detailed on  httpscaniusecom  
 im working on a linux machine and my distro ships chromium by default providing it from its standard repo for the sake of simplicity and keeping things clean i would prefer to avoid adding another external repo and install chrome just for this task if i can rely chromium to behave exactly the same and not have any compatibility issue 
 like i said this question is probably silly but given the differences between other chromiumbased browsers maybe this doubt of mine could be justified  
 edit please note that im not interested in the differences between google chrome and chromium from an user point of view or in details of their history and so on i only wish to know if from a website development point of view they are fully compatible or if they support the same set of features  in other words if i test a site from chromium can i be sure that it will work also in google chrome do they support the same exact set of css js and other webrelated technologies features

About the non-nullable types debate,"i keep hearing people talk about how nonnullable reference types would solve so many bugs and make programming so much easier even the creator of null calls it his  billion dollar mistake  and  spec  has introduced nonnullable types to combat this problem

 edit 2  i must be talking to the wrong people i was really hoping for somebody to argue with  
 
 so i would guess being in the minority that im wrong but i cant understand why this debate has any merit i see null as a bugfinding tool consider the following

    class c  nullptr

        code 
    forint i  0 i  ccount i

Disable antialiasing for a specific GDI device context,"im using a third party library to render an image to a gdi dc and i need to ensure that any text is rendered without any smoothingantialiasing so that i can convert the image to a predefined palette with indexed colors 
 the third party library im using for rendering doesnt support this and just renders text as per the current windows settings for font rendering theyve also said that its unlikely theyll add the ability to switch antialiasing off any time soon 
 the best work around ive found so far is to call the third party library in this way error handling and prior settings checks ommitted for brevity 
 private static void setfontsmoothingbool enabled

 snip
graphics graphics  graphicsfromimagebitmap
intptr devicecontext  graphicsgethdc

setfontsmoothingfalse
thirdpartycomponentrenderdevicecontext
setfontsmoothingtrue
 
 this obviously has a horrible effect on the operating system other applications flicker from cleartype enabled to disabled and back every time i render the image 
 so the question is does anyone know how i can alter the font rendering settings for a specific dc 
 even if i could just make the changes process or thread specific instead of affecting the whole operating system that would be a big step forward that would give me the option of farming this rendering out to a separate process the results are written to disk after rendering anyway 
 edit  id like to add that i dont mind if the solution is more complex than just a few api calls id even be happy with a solution that involved hooking system dlls if it was only about a days work 
 edit background information 
the thirdparty library renders using a palette of about 70 colors after the image which is actually a map tile is rendered to the dc i convert each pixel from its 32bit color back to its palette index and store the result as an 8bpp greyscale image this is uploaded to the video card as a texture during rendering i reapply the palette also stored as a texture with a pixel shader executing on the video card this allows me to switch and fade between different palettes instantaneously instead of needing to regenerate all the required tiles it takes between 1060 seconds to generate and upload all the tiles for a typical view of the world

How can I make sure N threads run at roughly the same speed?,"im toying with the idea of writing a physics simulation software in which each physical element would be simulated in its own thread 
 there would be several advantages to this approach it would be conceptually very close to how the real world works it would be much easier to scale the system to multiple machines 
 however for this to work i need to make sure that all threads run at the same speed with a rather liberal interpretation of same say within 1 of each others 
 thats why i dont necessarily need a threadjoin like solution i dont want some ubercontrolling school mistress that ensures all threads regularly synchronize with each others i just need to be able to ask the runtime whichever it iscould be java erlang or whatever is most appropriate for this problem to run the threads at a more or less equal speed 
 any suggestions would be extremely appreciated

Effective ways of finding an element in a Javascript array,"i am using an array with titles each titles index corresponds to an id in a database which contains html for that given title 
 lets say i have a string which contains one of the titles

titles  an array which contains all the titles
 
 to use the string title to get the corresponding id i could do 
 for i  0 i  titleslength1 i 
  if titlesi  title
    return i1

 
 another method i could use is to create an associative array together with the titles array which is the exact opposite of titles that is it uses the string as an index and returns the number 
 titlesid blah0whybirdsfly1blah22
 
 i could then access the id by 
 return titlesidtitle1
 
 what would be most effective considering cpu memory etc 
 also please let me know if my logic is all wrong

Passing NumPy arrays as arguments to numba.cfunc,"i have been fighting with an issue that i am having trouble wrapping my head around and therefore dont quite know how to start solving it my experience in programming c is very limited and that is i think the reason for which i cannot make progress 
 i have some function that uses  numpyinterp  and  scipyintegratequad  to carry out a certain integral since i use  quad  for the integration and according to its documentation 
 
 a python function or method to integrate if  func  takes many
  arguments it is integrated along the axis corresponding to the first
  argument 
 if the user desires improved integration performance then  f  may be a
   scipylowlevelcallable  with one of the signatures 
 double funcdouble x
double funcdouble x void userdata 
double funcint n double xx 
double funcint n double xx void userdata 
 
 the userdata is the data contained in the  scipylowlevelcallable  in the
  call forms with  xx   n  is the length of
  the  xx  array which contains  xx0  x  and the rest of the items are
  numbers contained in the args argument of quad 
 in addition certain ctypes call signatures are supported for backward
  compatibility but those should not be used in new code 
 
 i need to use the  scipylowlevelcallable  objects for speeding up my code and i need to stick my function design to one of the above signatures moreover since i do not want to be complicating the whole thing with c libraries and compilers i want to solve this on the fly with the tools available from  numba  in particular  numbacfunc  which allows me to bypass the python c api 
 i have been able to solve this for an integrand that takes as an input the integration variable and an arbitrary number of scalar parameters

 well now obviously this doesnt work because in this example i have not modified the design of the decorator but that is exactly the core of my question i do not fully understand this situation and therefore dont know how to modify the  cfunc  arguments for passing an array as parameter and still complying with the  scipyintegratequad  signature requirements in the  numba  documentation that introduces  cpointers  there is an example of how to pass an array to a  numbacfunc  
 
 native platform abis as used by c or c don’t have the notion of a
  shaped array as in numpy one common solution is to pass a raw data
  pointer and one or several size arguments depending on
  dimensionality numba must provide a way to rebuild an array view of
  this data inside the callback 
     from numba import cfunc carray
    from numbatypes import float64 cpointer void intp

     a callback with the c signature voiddouble  double  sizet

    cfuncvoidcpointerfloat64 cpointerfloat64 intp
    def invertinptr outptr n
        in  carrayinptr n
        out  carrayoutptr n
        for i in rangen
            outi  1  ini 
 
 
 i somehow understand that the  cpointer  is used for building the array in c as in the signature of my decorator example  cpointerfloat64  gathers all the floats passed as arguments and puts them into an array however i am still not able to put it together and see how i can use it for passing an array not for making an array out of the collection of  float  arguments i pass 
 edit 
 the answer by  max9111  worked in the sense that was able to pass to the  scipyintegratequad  a  lowlevelcallable  that improved the time efficiency of the calculation this is very valuable as now it is much clearer how management of memory addresses work in c even though the concept of structured array does not exist in native c i can create a structured array in python with data that c is going to store in a contiguous memory region and access itpoint to it through a unique memory address the mapping provided by the structured array allows for identifying the different components of that memory region 
 even though the solution by  max9111  works and solves the question i posted originally from the python perspective this approach introduces a certain overhead that under certain conditions might be more time consuming than the time gained by now calling the  scipyintegratequad  integration function via a  lowlevelcallable   
 in my real case i am using the integration as a step of a twodimensional optimization problem each step of the optimization requires to integrate twice and the integral requires nine scalar parameters ad two arrays as long as i have not been able to solve the integration via a  lowlevelcallable  the only thing i could do to speed up the code was to simply  njit  the integrand function and that worked decently even though the integration was still being fired via the python api 
 in my case implementing  max9111 s solution has greatly improved the efficiency in the integration time from about 00009s per step to about 00005  nevertheless the step of creating the structured array cunpacking the data pass it to the jitted integrand and return a  lowlevelcallable  has added an extra 03s on average per iteration thereby worsening my situation 
 here there is some toy code for showing how the  lowlevelcallable  approach becomes the worse option the more one goes for an iterative process

 here the two options only jitting the integrand vs  max9111 s solution are compared in a modified version of  max9111 s solution i have permanently jitted the integrand function  functionusingarrays  and removed that step from  createjitintegrandfunction  which reduces the overhead time by a neat 20 moreover also for the sake of speed i have suppressed the  jitwithdummydata  function and included its functionality in the body of  processlowlevcallable  basically for avoiding an unnecessary function call find in the following the calculation time for both solutions for a series of up to 100 cycles 
   
 as you can see if you are in an iterative process the time saved in each single calculation 30  does not pay off the overhead carried by the couple extra functions that you need to implement for building the lowlevelcallable functions that are as well called iteratively and run over the python c api 
 bottom line this solution is very good for reducing calculation time in one single very heavy integral but just jitting the integrand seems to be better off when solving average integrals within an iterative process since the extra functions required by the lowlevelcallable that need to be called as much often as the integration itself take their toll 
 anyway thank you very much even though this solution will not work for me i learned valuable things and i consider my question solved 
 edit 2 
 i misunderstood parts of  max9111 s solution and the role played by the function  createjitintegrandfunction  and i was wrongly compiling the  lowlevelcallable  in each step of my optimization which i do not need to do beacuse even though the parameters and arrays passed to the integral change each iteration their shape and therefore that of the c struct remains constant 
 the refactored version of the code from the above  edit  that makes sense

Is there a method to swap the left and right hand sides of a set of expressions in Visual Studio?,"i have a decent sized set of data that needs to be stored in an active record in order to prepopulate the form fields on the page i have already written the following code 
 device device  new devicedeviceid  device is simply the active record

txtnotestext  devicenotes
txthostnametext  devicehostname
txtassettagtext  deviceassettag
txtserialnumbertext  deviceserialnumber
 snip the list goes on
 
 is there some sort of the method builtin functionality macro etc that i could use to swap each side of the expression such that the data is saved into the active record as opposed to read from it in order to perform a database insert for example after highlighting the above code and running the macro it would become 
 devicedevicename  txtdevicenametext
devicenotes  txtnotestext
devicehostname  txthostnametext
deviceassettag  txtassettagtext
deviceserialnumber  txtserialnumbertext
 snip again
 
 since the number of columns in the database that this active record encapsulates is rather large it seems like most of this typing could be avoided with a simple automated process

Do FP and integer division compete for the same throughput resources on x86 CPUs?,"we know that intel cpus do integer division and fp div  sqrt on a notfullypipelined divide execution unit on port 0  we know this from  iaca output  other published stuff and experimental testing  eg  httpsagnerorgoptimize

 this is complicated by intel cpus unlike amd decoding integer division to multiple uops eg 10 for  div r32  on skylake 
 
 amd cpus similarly have their divider on one execution port but i dont know as much about them and dont have one to test on  amd integer division decodes to only a couple uops to write rdx and rax not microcoded  experiments on amd might be easier to interpret without lots of uops flying around being a possible cause for contention between int and fp div

Turn image sequence into video with transparency,"ive got what seems like it should be a really simple problem but its proving much harder than i expected  heres the issue 
 ive got a fairly large image sequence consisting of numbered frames output from maya for what its worth  the images are currently in targa tga format but i could convert them to pngs or other arbitrary format if that matters  the important thing is theyve got an alpha channel 
 what i want to do is programatically turn them into a video clip  the format doesnt really matter but it needs to be lossless and have an alpha channel  uncompressed video in a quicktime container would probably be ideal 
 my initial thought was ffmpeg but after wasting most of a day on it it seems its got no support at all for alpha channels  either im missing something or the underlying libavcodec just doesnt do it 
 so whats the right way here  a command line tool like ffmpeg would be nice but any solution that runs on windows and could be called from a script would be fine 
 note  having an alpha chanel in your video isnt actually all that uncommon and its really useful if you want to composite it on top of another video clip or a still image  as far as i know uncompressed video the quicktime animation codec and the sorenson video 3 codec all support tranparency and ive heard h264 does as well  all were really talking about is 32bit color depth and thats pretty widely supported both quicktime mov files and windowss avi files can handle it and probably a lot more too 
 quicktime pro is more than happy to turn an image sequence into a 32bit mov file  hit export change color depth to millions of colors select the animation codec crank the quality up to 100 and there you are  losslessly compressed video with an alpha chanel and itll play back almost anywhere since the codec has been part of quicktime since version 10  the problem is quicktime pro doesnt have any sort of commandline interface at least on windows  ffmpeg supports encoding using the quicktime animation codec which it calls qtrle but it only supports a bitdepth of 24 bits 
 the issue isnt finding a video format that supports an alpha channel  quicktime animation would be ideal but even uncompressed video should work  the problem is finding a tool that supports it

What is the best practice for readonly lists in NHibernate,"domain model i am working on has root aggregate and child entities 
something like the following code 
 class order

   ilistorderline lines getset


class orderline


 
 now i want my order to control lines something like that

   void addlineorderline line

 
 at this time we are using the following pattern 
 class order

   private ilistorderline lines  new listorderline
   orderline lines get return thislines

   void addlineorderline line
   
      thisordersaddline
   

 
 nhibernate is mapped directly to the lines field 
 now questions 
 
 what do you practice in such situations 
 does anyone use methods 
public ienumerable getlines 
 what are you using as return type for property may be readonlycollection or ienumerable 
 may be this is not the best place to ask suggest please

Why is 'this' a pointer and not a reference?,"i was reading the answers to this question  c pros and cons  and got this doubt while reading the comments 
 
 programmers frequently find it confusing that this is a pointer but not a reference another confusion is why hello is not of type stdstring but evaluates to a char const pointer after array to pointer conversion – johannes schaub  litb dec 22 08 at 156 
 that only shows that it doesnt use the same conventions as other later languages – le dorfier dec 22 08 at 335 
 id call the this thing a pretty trivial issue though and oops thanks for catching a few errors in my examples of undefined behavior  although i dont understand what info about size has to do with anything in the first one a pointer is simply not allowed to point outside allocated memory – jalf dec 22 08 at 418 
 is this a constant poiner – yesraaj dec 22 08 at 635 
 this can be constant if the method is const int getfoo const  in the scope of getfoo this is constant and is therefore readonly this prevents bugs and provides some level of guarantee to the caller that the object wont change – doug t dec 22 08 at 1642 
 you cant reassign this ie you cannot do this  other because this is an rvalue but this is of type t not of type t const  ie its a nonconstant pointer if you are in a const method then its a pointer to const t const  but the pointer itself is nonconst – johannes schaub  litb dec 22 08 at 1753 
 think of this like this define this this  0 where the compiler creates this as a pointer to the object and makes this a keyword you cant assign this because this  0 is an rvalue of course thats not how it is there is no such macro but it can help understand it – johannes schaub  litb dec 22 08 at 1755 
 
 my question is why is  this  a pointer a not a reference any particular reason for making it a pointer 
 
 some further arguments why  this  being a reference would make sense 
 
 consider  item 1  from  more effective c   use references when it is guaranteed that we have a valid object ie not a null my interpretation 
 furthermore references are considered safer than pointers because we cant screw the memory up with a stray pointer 
 thirdly the syntax for accessing references    is a little bit nicer and shorter than accessing pointers    or

implementation for product keys,"im implementing a small application in c which i would like to sell as shareware for a reasonable price later on it will start of with a 30day trial which i am already quite certain of how to implement it 
 the problem i have though is that i am not quite sure how to implement the product key verification what i have in mind is that the customer can sign up on my webpage after trying the product for a while pay for the product and get a product key in the form of aaaaabbbbbcccccdddddeeeee via email or maybe available via his profile on my website no problem so far heshe then drops the key in the appropriate key fields in my app and  boom  the app is registered 
 from what i could gather so far people either recommend aes or rsa for this to be honest i in another direction in college not cryptography and the one cryptography class i took was some time ago but from what i remember aes is a symmetric encryption algorithm which would mean that i would only have one key for encryption and decryption right how could i then generate thousands of product keys and still validate them in my app which by the way wont require internet accessso no checking back with a server 
 so i guess rsa would be the way to go but doesnt rsa produce pretty long keys at least longer than the required 25 characters from above 
 in  another thread  i read that some products wont even use encryption for the product key generationverification but instead just employ some checks like add the 2 and the 17 character and that should total to x  
 whats the fastest easiest and most secure way to go here  code samples would be sugar 
 regards 
 sebastian  
 ps ohand please dont tell me how my key can and will be cracked at some pointi know about that which is primarily why i dont want to spend a lot of time with this issue but at the same time not make it too easy for the occasional cracker

Changing the inputview property of a UITextView from a custom view to nil leads to a crash,"i believe ive come across a bug in ios 7 when a uitextview is contained in a modal view having its inputview property changed from a custom view to nil in order to bring back the system keyboard will cause the app to crash after the modal view is dismissed 
 this crash only occurs under ios 7 previous versions of ios did not exhibit this problem 
 i wrote a small  sample app  to demonstrate the problem compile the launch the app and do the following 
 
 tap the button show textview this will present a modal
viewcontroller containing a uitextview and three buttons 
 tap the button set inputview to emptyview this will create an
empty uiview and assign it to the inputview property of the
uitextview 
 tap the button set inputview to nil this will assign nil to the
inputview property of uitextview this is done in order to show the
system keyboard 
 tap the button dismiss viewcontroller this will dismiss the view
controller to return to the original view controller 
 
 as soon as the viewcontroller is dismissed the app crashes immediately the crash log sometimes but not always refers to an unrecognized selector being sent to an object the objects type is different every time the crash is reproduced 
 has anyone else come across this sort of bug

Detecting whether a GPS coordinate falls within a polygon on a map,"as stated in the title the goal is to have a way for detecting whether a given gps coordinate falls inside a polygon or not 
 the polygon itself can be either convex or concave its defined as a set of edge vectors and a known point within that polygon each edge vector is further defined by four coordinates which are the  latitudes and longitudes  of respective tip points and a bearing relative to the starting point 
 there are a couple of questions similar to this one here on stackoverflow but they describe the solution only in general terms and for a 2d plane whereas i am looking for an existing implementation that supports polygons defined by latitudelongitude pairs in  wgs 84  
 what apis or services are out there for doing such collision tests

Specifying image dimensions in HTML vs CSS for page loading,"ive learnt from somewhere a long time ago that specifying width and height for  img  elements in an html document speeds up and improves the page loading experience and have generally kept to this practice 
 img src width100 height100 
 
 im now faced with a situation where i have a very large number of images on a single page and id prefer to set the dimensions via css for both easier control and less repetitive html code 
 whatever img width 100px height 100px
 
 although this isnt a hugely serious issue im wondering whether declaring the dimensions in css will have the same benefits as declaring the dimensions in html or whether it ought to just be done in html directly 
 any insight would be welcome 
 thanks

Django stripe js blocking of inline script,"im trying to implement stripe payment system in django for adding card payments i followed the guide in  this link  after adding html markup in django template and css and js code as separate static files i got the following console error in firefox 
 content security policy the page’s settings blocked the loading of a resource at inline “scriptsrc”
 
 what i understand from above error message is that  script srchttpsjsstripecomv3script  js file contains links to other js files and firefox blocks such connections it should be noted that at this stage test credit card payment is working as expected and amount debited by client is added to my stripe accounts test balance to address this blocking problem i followed the instructions in  this link  as such i added following  meta  tag to my django template 
 meta httpequivcontentsecuritypolicy contentconnectsrc httpsapistripecom framesrc httpsjsstripecom httpshooksstripecom scriptsrc httpsjsstripecom 
 
 after adding above  contentsecuritypolicy  directives firefox console no longer shows aforementioned blocking errors but this time my static js files are blocked i have modified directives as below for allowing my js files added  self  to  scriptsrc  directive

 and this time before mentioned inlinescript block error reappeared in firefox console   
 can you help me for this issue is my understanding correct regarding the cause of firefox console error why implemented solution is not working

 can it be simply firefox bug considering that payment is working as expected and chromium browser does not log any error on developer tools

 i also tried running  gradle dorggradlenativefalse build  as well but the outcome was the same 
 now as far as what user is calling the script i believe it is wwwdata as im running an apache2 web server and php

 how would you go about finding the best combination programmatically 
 my best attempt so far third or fourth algorithm is 
 
 find the longest shipper for each leg 
 eliminate the most expensive one 
 find the cheapest shipper for each leg 
 calculate the total cost  days 
 if days are acceptable finish else goto 1

Can placement new for arrays be used in a portable way?,"is it possible to actually make use of placement new in portable code when using it for arrays 
 it appears that the pointer you get back from new is not always the same as the address you pass in 534 note 12 in the standard seems to confirm that this is correct but i dont see how you can allocate a buffer for the array to go in if this is the case 
 the following example shows the problem compiled with visual studio this example results in memory corruption 
 include new
include stdioh

class a

    public

    a  data0 
    virtual a 
    int data


int main

    const int numelements20

    char pbuffer  new charnumelementssizeofa
    a pa  newpbuffer anumelements

     with vc pa will be four bytes higher than pbuffer
    printfbuffer address x array address xn pbuffer pa

     debug runtime will assert here due to heap corruption
    delete pbuffer

    return 0

 
 looking at the memory the compiler seems to be using the first four bytes of the buffer to store a count of the number of items in it this means that because the buffer is only  sizeofanumelements  big the last element in the array is written into unallocated heap 
 so the question is can you find out how much additional overhead your implementation wants in order to use placement new safely ideally i need a technique thats portable between different compilers note that at least in vcs case the overhead seems to differ for different classes for instance if i remove the virtual destructor in the example the address returned from new is the same as the address i pass in

JNI and Java: ant calling make or make calling ant?,"im just about to make my first trip into the world of jni java native interface to provide file system change notifications from platform specific cc code to java that is unless someone suggest some brilliant library for doing this that ive missed 
 being new to jni ive managed to find much documentation on the interface side of it and library generation side of it but ive not found much on building the native library 
 ive got an existing build based on ant for the preexisting java source so im trying to work out if i should get ant to call make  to create the library or if its best to get make to call ant after creating the library 
 neither option jumps out as being terribly nice but both seem better than trying to get ant to call a compiler to compile the code and generate the library directly

Can you really build a fast word processor with GoF Design Patterns?,"the gang of fours  design patterns  uses a word processor as an example for at least a few of their patterns particularly composite and flyweight 
 other than by using c or c could you really use those patterns and the objectoriented overhead they entail to write a highperforming fully featured word processor  
 i know that eclipse is written in java but i havent used it much so i dont know if its all that fast or as polished as something like visual studio which has a c based text editing system 
 
 i only used c and java as examples the question has more to do with the overhead of having a lot of inmemory objects like you would in an application such as a word processor or even a game  
 design patterns promote abstraction at the expense of parsimony even though they usually point out when you might take some kind of performance hit word processors and especially games get the most benefit from being as close to the metal as possible  
 i was just wondering if anyone knew of an fast objectoriented word processor or text editor that wasnt written in c and whether theyd build one using patterns or would they forgoe a lot of the abstracting away of things

Prototyping with Python code before compiling,"i have been mulling over writing a peakfitting library for a while i know python fairly well and plan on implementing everything in python to begin with but envisage that i may have to reimplement some core routines in a compiled language eventually 
 iirc one of pythons original remits was as a prototyping language however python is pretty liberal in allowing functions functors objects to be passed to functions and methods whereas i suspect the same is not true of say c or fortran 
 what should i know about designing functionsclasses which i envisage will have to interface into the compiled language and how much of these potential problems are dealt with by libraries such as ctypes bgen  swig   boostpython   cython  or  python sip  
 for this particular use case a fitting library i imagine allowing users to define mathematical functions guassian lorentzian etc as python functions which can then to be passed an interpreted by the compiled code fitting library passing and returning arrays is also essential

AG-Grid with Redux,"in my job we decided to use  aggrid  in react variant  httpswwwaggridcombestreactdatagridindexphp 
 currently our architecture for  react  is  redux  from my little knowledge of  aggrid  i can say that it doesnt fit very well to this architecture  aggrid  keeps its overall state inside the component its cumbersome or even not clever to try to connect it to redux forcefully and completely 
 i can live with that but at least i need to watch for the row model changes  meaning fetches of new rows sorts filtering i dont need to watch for cell changes i have 2 ideas on how to watch for this and connect it to redux 
 option 1  use gridoptionsonmodelupdated 
 with  gridoptionsonmodelupdated  i know when filtering or sort was executed but i cant get to all rows displayed  docs  
 
 state 1 row data 
 api there is no api to get this data however it was provided by the application so you should already have it 
 
 thus i cant dispatch a  redux  action as i dont have any data to update it with 
 option 2  datasourcegetrows 
 i could dispatch actions with new rows however i havent found any  onresetonrowsdeleted  event thus i dont know when to clear reduxs  staterows   update  i can know that previous rows were cleared if argumernt  params  of  datasourcegetrowsparams  is  paramsstartrow  0  
 question 
 maybe i find a way how to use one of the 2 options but my question is 
 are those good ideas to how connect  aggrid  to  redux

ASP.NET Custom Controls - Composites,"summary 
 hi all 
ok further into my adventures with custom controls 
 in summary here is that i have learned of three main classes of custom controls please feel free to correct me if any of this is wrong 
 
 usercontrols   which inherit from  usercontrol  and are contained within an  ascx  file these are pretty limited in what they can do but are a quick and light way to get some ui commonality with designer support 
 custom composite controls   these are controls that inherit from  webcontrol  where you add preexisting controls to the control within the  createchildcontrols  method this provides great flexibility but lack of designer support without additional coding they are highly portable though since they can be compiled into a dll 
 custom rendered controls   similar to custom composite controls these are added to a web control library project the rendering of the control is completely controlled by the programmer by overriding the  render  method 
 
 my thoughts 
 ok so while playing with custom composites i found the following 
 
 you have littleno control over the html output making it difficult to debug 
 the  createchildcontrols  and subsequent methods can get real busy with  controlsaddmycontrol  everywhere 
 i found rendering tables be it for layout or content to be considerably awkward 
 
 the questions 
 so i admit i am new to this so i could be way offbase with some of my points noted above 
 
 do you use composites 
 do you have any neat tricks to control the html output 
 do you just say to hell with it and go ahead and create a custom rendered control 
 
 its something i am keen to get really firm in my mind since i know how much  good  control development can cut overall development time 
 i look forward to your answers

"Large, Complex Objects as a Web Service Result","hello again ladies and gents 
 ok following on from my other question on  aspnet web service results proxy classes and type conversion  ive come to a part in my project where i need to get my thinking cap on 
 basically we have a large complex custom object that needs to be returned from a web service and consumed in the client application 
 now based on the previous discussion we know this is going to then take the form of the proxy classes as the return type to overcome this we need to basically copy the properties from one to the other 
 in this case that is something that i would really really  really  like to avoid 
 so it got me thinking  how else could we do this 
 my current thoughts are to enable the object for complete serialization to xml and then return the xml as a string from the web service we then deserialize at the client this will mean a fair bit of attribute decorating but at least the code at both endpoints will be light namely by just using the net xml serializer 
 what are your thoughts on this

C# Char* to String,"ive looked around a lot and cant seem to find a solution to anything similar to what im doing i have two applications a native c app and a managed c app the c app allocates a pool of bytes that are used in a memory manager each object allocated in this memory manager has a header and each header has a char that points to a name given to the object the c app acts as a viewer for this memory i use memory mapped files to allow the c app to read the memory while the c app is running my issue is that i am trying to read the name of the object from the header structure and display it in c or just store it in a string whatever using unsafe code i am able to convert the four bytes that make up the  char  into an  intptr  convert that to a  void  and call  marshalptrtostringansi  this is the code 
 intptr nameptr  new intrptrbitconvertertoint32bytes index
unsafe

    void ptr  nameptrtopointer
    char cptr  charptr
    output  marshalptrtostringansiintptrptr

 
 in this case  bytes  is the array read from the memory mapped file that represents all of the pool of bytes created by the native app and  index  is the index of the first byte of the name pointer 
 i have verified that on the managed side of things the address returned by the call to  nameptrtopointer  is exactly the address of the name pointer in the native app if this were native code i would simply cast  ptr  to a  char  and it would be fine but in managed code ive read i must use the marshaller to do this 
 this code yields varying results sometimes  cptr  is null sometimes it points to  0  and other times it points to a few asian characters which when run through the  ptrtostringansi  method produce seemingly irrelevant characters i thought it might be a  fixed  thing but  topointer  produces a fixed pointer and sometimes after the cast to a  char  the debugger says  unable to evaluate the expression the pointer is not valid  or something like that its not easy to repro every varying thing that comes back and other times i get an access violation when reading the memory which leads me to the c side of things 
 on the c side i figured there might be some issues with actually reading the memory because although the memory that stores the pointer is part of the memory mapped file the actual bytes that make up the text are not so i looked at how to change readwrite access to memory on windows mind you and found the virtualprotect method in the windows libraries which i use to change access to the memory to pageexecutewritecopy which i figured would give any application that has a pointer to that address will be able to at least read whats there but that didnt solve the issue either 
 to put it shortly 
 i have a pointer in c to the first char in a char array that was allocated in a c app and am trying to read that array of chars into a string in c 
 edit 
 the source header looks like this 
 struct allocatorheader

 these bytes are reserved and their purposes may change
char reserved4

 a pointer to a destructor mapping that is associated with this object
destructormappingbase destructor

 the size of the object this header is for
unsigned int size

char name

 
 the  name  field is the one im trying to dereference in c 
 edit 
 as of now even using the solutions provided below i am unable to dereference this char in managed code as such i have simply made a copy of the char in the pool referenced by the memory mapped file and use a pointer to that this works which makes me believe this is a protectionrelated issue if i find a way to circumvent this at some point i will answer my own question until then this will be my workaround thanks to all who helped

Why GCC and MSVC std::normal_distribution are different?,"i have a simple code sample

 which i compile on  gcc  and  msvc  i get diferent results on std code
 
 so why gcc and msvc  stdnormaldistribution  results are diferent for the same seed and generator and most importantly how to  force  them to be same

Creating a SOAP client in java given a WSDL file,"i have never used any soap libraries in java so i apologize for the newbyness of this question 
 i am trying to take advantage of tivoli endpoint managers soap api i have generated the necessary classes from the wsdl file provided using wsimportexe provided in the jdk 
 now i am provided with a ton of classes that i assume are packaging the information into xml format but i am unsure what to do with them i have read the documentation provided but it is fuzzy at best  
 the classes generated by wsimport are the following 
 
 according to the documentation the following perl code works for querying the tivolis api 
 use soaplite
arguments hostname username password relevance expression
hostname only eg ’examplecom’ rather than ’httpexamplecomwebreports’
my host  argv0
my username  soapdataname’username’  argv1 
my password  soapdataname’password’  argv2 
my expr  soapdataname’relevanceexpr’  argv3 
my service  soaplite  uri ’http’  host  ’webreportswsdl’ 
 proxy host 
my result  service  getrelevanceresult expr username password 
if resultfault  
     print faultcode   resultfaultcode  n
     print faultstring   resultfaultstring  n

else 
     foreach my answer  resultvalueof getrelevanceresultresponsea   
           print answer  n
     

 
 question what are the equivalent soap client libraries in java the ones that i googled are so heavy 15mb 
 how would i write the the equivalent java stub code for the perl above

 solution 
 this was much simpler than i thought wsdl generation did all the work here is how you use those generated classes

File Access Strategy in a Multi-Threaded Environment (Web App),"i have a file which is an xml representation of some data that is taken from a web service and cached locally within a web application the idea being is that this data is  very  static but just  might  change so i have set it up to cache to a file and stuck a monitor against it to check if it has been deleted once deleted the file will be refreshed from its source and rebuilt 
 i am now running in to problems though because obviously in a multithreaded environment it falls over as it is trying to access the data when it is still readingwriting the file 
 this is confusing me because i added a object to lock against and this is always locked during readwrite it was my understanding that attempted access from other threads would be told to wait until the lock was released 
 just to let you know i am real new to multithreaded development so i am totally willing to accept this is a screw up on my part  
 
 am i missing something 
 what is the best file access strategy in a multithreaded environment

Handling autorotation for one view controller in iOS7,"ive read many answers on so but i cant seem to get autorotation working on ios7 
 i only need one view controller to rotate so i dont want to set rotation settings in my infoplist

 boolshouldautorotate

 if i do configure infoplist with the proper rotation settings my view will rotate but not if i try and rely on my view controller 
 not sure if it matters but the view im trying to rotate is from a xib using auto layout

Practical application of backticks in Swift,"from  this document  
 
 to use a reserved word as an identifier put a backtick  before and after it 
 
 im curious about the practical application of this when would you actually want to name something  class   self  etc 
 or relatedly why did the designers of swift allow this rather than just forbidding us from using reserved words as identifiers

A python web application framework for tight DB/GUI coupling?,"im a firm believer of the heretic thought of tight coupling between the backend and frontend i want existing implied knowledge about a backend to be automatically made use of when generating user interfaces eg if a varchar column has a maximum with of 20 characters there guis should automatically constrain the user from typing more than 20 characters in a related form field 
 and i have strong antipathy to orms which want to define my database tables or are based on some hack where every table needs to have extra numeric id columns because of the orm 
 ive looked a bit into python database frameworks and i think i can conclude the sqlalchemy fits best to my mentality 
 now i need to find a web application framework which fits naturally with sqlalchemy or an equivalent and perhaps even with my appetite for coupling with web application framework i mean productsproject such as pyhons django turbogears web2py etc 
 eg it should ideally be able to 
 
 automatically select a suitable form widget  for data entering a given column if told to do so eg if the column has a foreign key to a column with 10 different values widget should display the 10 possible values as a dropdown 
 autogenerate javascript form validation code  which gives the enduser quick error feedback if a string is entered into a field which is about to end up in an integer column etc 
 autogenerate a  calendar widget  for data which will end up in a date column 
 hint not null constraints  as javascript which complains about empty or whitespaceonly data in a related input field 
 generate javascript validation code which matches relevant simple  checkconstraints 
 make it easy to  avoid sql injection  by using prepared statements andor validation of externally derived data 
 make it easy to  avoid cross site scripting  by automatically escape outgoing strings when appropriate 
 make use of constraint names  to generate somewhat user friendly error messages in case a constrataint is violated 
 
 all this should happen dynamically so table adjustments are automatically reflected on the frontend  probably with a caching mechanism so that all the model introspection wouldnt kill performance in other words i dont want to repeat my model definition in an xml file or alike when it has already been carefully been defined in my database 
 does such a framework exist for python or for any language for that matter if not which of the several python web application frameworks will be least in the way if i were to add parts of the above features myself

Propagation of Oracle Transactions Between C++ and Java,"we have an existing c application that we are going to gradually replace with a new javabased system  until we have completely reimplemented everything in java we expect the c and java to have to communicate with each other rmi soap messaging etc  we havent decided 
 now my manager thinks well need the java and c sides to participate in the same oracle db transaction  this is related to but different from the usual distrbuted transaction problem of having a single process coordinate 2 transactional resources such as a db and a message queue 
 i think propagating a transaction across processes is a terrible idea from a performance and stability pointofview but i am still going to be asked for a solution 
 i am familiar with xa transactions and ive done some work with the jboss transaction manager but my googling hasnt turned up anything good on propagating an xa transaction between 2 processes 
 we are using spring on the java side and their documentation explicitly states they do not provide any help with transaction propagation 
 we are not planning on using a traditional java ee server for example ibm websphere which may have support for propagation not that i can find any definitive documentation 
 any help or pointers on solutions is greatly appreciated

Caching a generator,"a recent similar question  isinstancefoo typesgeneratortype or inspectisgeneratorfoo  got me curious about how to implement this generically  
 it seems like a generallyuseful thing to have actually to have a generatortype object that will cache the first time through like  itertoolscycle  report stopiteration and then return items from the cache next time through but if the object isnt a generator ie a list or dict that inherently supports o1 lookup then dont cache and have the same behaviour but for the original list 
 possibilities 
 1 modify itertoolscycle it looks like this 
 def cycleiterable
    saved  
    try 
         savedappenditerablenext
         yield saved1
         isiter  true
    except
         saved  iterable
         isiter  false
     cycleabcd  a b c d a b c d a b c d 
    for element in iterable
        yield element
        if isiter 
            savedappendelement

       what next
 
 if i could restart the generator that would be perfect  i could send back a stopiteration and then on the next gennext return entry 0 ie a b c d stopiteration a b c d stopiteration but it doesnt look like thats actually possible  
 second would be that once stopiteration is hit then saved has a cache but it doesnt look like theres any way to get to the internal saved field maybe a class version of this  
 2 or i could pass in the list directly 
 def cycleiterable saved
    savedclear
    try 
         savedappenditerablenext
         yield saved1
         isiter  true
    except
         saved  iterable
         isiter  false
     cycleabcd  a b c d a b c d a b c d 
    for element in iterable
        yield element
        if isiter 
            savedappendelement

mysaved  
myiter  cyclesomeiter mysaved
 
 but that just looks nasty and in c i could pass in some reference and change the actual reference to saved to point to iterable  you cant actually do that in python so this doesnt even work 
 other options  
 edit more data the cachingiterable method appears to be too slow to be effective but it did push me in a direction that might work its slightly slower than the naive method converting to list myself but appears not to take the hit if its already iterable 
 some code and data 
 def cubegeneratormax100
    i  0
    while i  max
        yield iii
        i  1

 base case use generator each time
timeit
cg  cubegenerator x for x in cg
cg  cubegenerator x for x in cg
cg  cubegenerator x for x in cg
10000 loops best of 3 554 us per loop

 fastest case flatten to list then iterate

 another attempt which is closer to the above
 not exactly the original solution using next but close enough i guess
class cachegenobject
    def initself iterable
        if isinstanceiterable list tuple dict
            selfmyiter  iterable
        else
            selfmyiter  listiterable
    def iterself
        return selfmyiteriter
    def containsself key
        return selfmyitercontainskey
    def getitemself key

timeit
cg  cubegenerator
ci  cachegencg
x for x in ci

Unicode filenames on FAT-32?,"as far as i understand  ntfs supports unicode filenames utf16 as micorsoft claims 
 but official msdn documentation is very vague regarding what codepages is used to store filenames filepaths on fat32

 but here it turns out that there can be different  oem codepages  with cp437 being one of them  httpmsdnmicrosoftcomenuslibrarywindowsdesktopdd317752aspx 
 and we all now that utilities like  mount  support many more different codepages for fat more than just oem codepages set 
 so what is the actual cdepage for fat32 filenames it depends on the system codepage at the time when fat volume was created can fat support true double byte character set codepages like utf16 or multi byte character set codepages like utf8 is the limit

Loop read each line of a file to its own array,"i have a text file it can vary in number of lines but will always have 24 tab deliberated entries on each line  
 4 of these entries are dates but theyre not in the normal yyyymmdd format example 20130311t2035330000 so i use substr and thats all fine however currently i pass all the data from the file to a table then take each date do the substr and update the fields to then pass all this table to another but with the date field types as date as first time round they cant due to 20130311t2035330000 
 the point im getting at is id like to read each line into an array apply the substr to the dates which will always be in the same position then pass the array into the table so the data type for the column can be date from the get go 
 i just cant seem to figure out how to loop round for each line in the file i can get the first line as i need to delete that ive read that getting a specific line is impossible or hard but i just need it to loop through them periodicity  
 i currently have

 which loops for each row in the table but i dont know how or if this can be implimented for the file lines

Calling non-static member function outside of object's lifetime in C++17,"does the following program have undefined behavior in c17 and later 
 struct a 
    void fint   assume there is no access to this here  


int main 
    auto a  new a
    afaa 0

 
 c17 guarantees that  af  is evaluated to the member function of the  a  object before the calls argument is evaluated therefore the indirection from    is welldefined but before the function call is entered the argument is evaluated and ends the lifetime of the  a  object see however the edits below does the call still have undefined behavior is it possible to call a member function of an object outside its lifetime in this way 
 the value category of  af  is prvalue by  exprref632  and  basiclife7  does only disallow nonstatic member function calls on  glvalues  referring to the afterlifetime object does this imply the call is valid edit as discussed in the comments i am likely misunderstanding basiclife7 and it probably does apply here 
 does the answer change if i replace the destructor call  aa  with  delete a  or  newa a  with  includenew  
 
 some elaborating edits and clarifications on my question 
 
 if i were to separate the member function call and the destructordeleteplacementnew into two statements i think the answers are clear 
 
 aa af0  ub because of nonstatic member call on  a  outside its lifetime see edit below though 
 delete a af0  same as above 
 newa a af0  welldefined call on the new object 
 
 however in all these cases  af  is sequenced after the first respective statement while this order is reversed in my initial example my question is whether this reversal does allow for the answers to change 
 
 for standards before c17 i initially thought that all three cases cause undefined behavior already because the evaluation of  af  depends on the value of  a  but is unsequenced relative to the evaluation of the argument which causes a sideeffect on  a  however this is undefined behavior only if there is an actual sideeffect on a scalar value eg writing to a scalar object however no scalar object is written to because  a  is trivial and therefore i would also be interested in what constraint exactly is violated in the case of standards before c17 as well in particular the case with placementnew seems unclear to me now 
 
 i just realized that the wording about the lifetime of objects changed between c17 and the current draft in n4659 c17 draft basiclife1 says 
 
 the lifetime of an object o of type t ends when  
 
 if t is a class
  type with a nontrivial destructor 154 the destructor call starts 
 
  
 
 while the  current draft  says 
 
 the lifetime of an object o of type t ends when 
  
 
 if t is a class type the destructor call starts or 
 
  
 
 therefore i suppose my example does have welldefined behavior in c17 but not he current c20 draft because the destructor call is trivial and the lifetime of the  a  object isnt ended i would appreciate clarification on that as well my original question does still stands even for c17 for the case of replacing the destructor call with delete or placementnew expression 
 
 if  f  accesses  this  in its body then there may be undefined behavior for the cases of destructor call and delete expression however in this question i want to focus on whether the call in itself is valid or not
note however that the variation of my question with placementnew would potentially not have an issue with member access in  f  depending on whether the call itself is undefined behavior or not but in that case there might be a followup question especially for the case of placementnew because it is unclear to me whether  this  in the function would then always automatically refer to the new object or whether it might need to potentially be  stdlaunder ed depending on what members  a  has 
 
 while  a  does have a trivial destructor the more interesting case is probably where it has some side effect about which the compiler may want to make assumptions for optimization purposes i dont know whether any compiler uses something like this therefore i welcome answers for the case where  a  has a nontrivial destructor as well especially if the answer differs between the two cases 
 also from a practical perspective a trivial destructor call probably does not affect the generated code and unlikely optimizations based on undefined behavior assumptions aside all code examples will most likely generate code that runs as expected on most compilers i am more interested in the theoretical rather than this practical perspective 
 
 this question intends to get a better understanding of the details of the language i do not encourage anyone to write code like that

Losing reference to transitioningDelegate before presetentation presentation,"i had a working custom uipresentationcontroller prior to xcode beta 2 and ios 10 beta 2 i havent changed any code but the presentation is now being presented with the standard modal presentation 
 there is a note in the apple sample code for uipresentationcontroller that says 
 
 for presentations which will use a custom presentation controller 
  it is possible for that presentation controller to also be the 
  transitioningdelegate  this avoids introducing another object  or
  implementing  in the  source
  view controller 
 transitioningdelegate does not hold a strong reference to its destination objectto prevent presentationcontroller from being
  released prior to calling presentviewcontrolleranimatedcompletion 
  the nsvaliduntilendofscope attribute is appended to the
  declaration 
 
 ive checked the transitioningdelegate on the presented view controller before and after the presentation before it is my custom uipresentationcontroller but after it is nil my guess is that the reference is being released but i cannot find an equivalent to nsvaliduntilendofscope in swift  edit  ive verified that transitioningdelegate is set up until just before the presentation and then is nil when it is time to present

android textureview full screen preview with correct aspect ratio,"i have been working with the  camera2 api demo from google  and unfortunately the sample application is built to display the textureview preview at approximately 70 of the screen height after looking around i was able to determine that this was being caused by the autofittextureview overriding the  onmeasure  method as shown below

Preventing adjacent/overlapping entries with EXCLUDE in PostgreSQL,"i am creating a database which stores arbitrary datetime ranges in postgresql 924 i want to place a constraint on this database which forces the datetime ranges to be nonoverlapping and nonadjacent since two adjacent ranges can be expressed as a single continuous range

 the columns  from  and  to  are both  timestamp without time zone  and are datetimes stored in utc i convert to utc before inserting data into these columns in my application and i have my databases timezone set to utc in postgresqlconf

Storing Windows passwords,"im writing in c with net 35 an administrative application which will poll multiple windows systems for various bits of data in many cases it will use wmi but in some cases it may need to read remote registry or remotely execute some command or script on the polled system this polling will happen at repeating intervals  usually nightly but can be configured to happen more or less frequently so the poll could happen as often as every 10 minutes or as rarely as once a month it needs to happen in an automated way without any human intervention 
 these functions will require adminlevel access to the polled systems now i expect that in most use cases there will be a domain and the polling application can run as a service with domain admin or equivalent privileges which means i do not have to worry about storing passwords  the admin setting up the app will define the services usernamepassword via standard windows mechanisms 
 but theres always a few black sheep out there the program may run in nondomain environments or in cases where some polled systems are not members of the domain in these cases we will have to define a username and password store them securely then invoke this userpass pair at the time we poll that system so keep in mind  in this case the program being written  is the user  who  sends  password to the authenticating system  
 i am not sure whether i will need to use a reversible hash which i then decrypt to plaintext at time of use or if there is some windows mechanism which would allow me to store and then reuse the hash only obviously the second mechanism is preferable id like my program to either  never  know the passwords plaintext value or know it for the shortest amount of time possible 
 i need suggestions for smart and secure ways to accomplish this

Generating API documents in Git Workflow,"not sure if this should be here or on  programmers  
 generating api documents 
 i would like some advice on how i should generate api documentation for an internal project i am relatively new to git and we are trying to implement some sound builddeploying practices 
 one of the things we discussed was making sure our code base is well documented and generating documentation using something like phpdocumentor2 or one of the many similar tools 
 we have started to implement a workflow similar to the one detailed  here   
 
 should i automate when the docs are built 
 for example a pre or post commit hook in git when tagging a release or should when i merge develop to a release branch just manually create the docs and commit to the repository 
 is it standard practice to have docs generated for each release 
 i might have misunderstood the process should a new doc release correlate with a git releasetag 
 where do you store the generated docs 
 in the same repository a different repository hosted somewhere like  read the docs  or just internally
the current project we are working on is only small but we would like to roll out the process to other larger projects in the future if successful 
 context 
 the project is a magento extension which we would like to provide api docs unit testing and psr conforming code i am lacking information on how the whole workflow integrates phpunit and phpdocumentor2 are installed locally via composer 
 i have heard and looked at travis ci but im not sure if docs fall in to that category 
 this question may seem petty andor trivial however ive not much experience in integration and git workflow and i couldnt find much information around

Tomcat vs Weblogic JNDI Lookup,"the weblogic servers we are using have been configured to allow jndi datasource names like appds 
 for development localhost we might be running tomcat and when declared in the context section of serverxml tomcat will hang jndi datasources on javacompenvjdbc in the jndi tree 
 problem  in weblogic the jndi lookup is appds whilst in tomcat it seems that that i must provide the formal javacompenvjdbcappds im afraid the tomcat version is an implicit standard but unfortunately i cant change weblogics config  so that means we end up with two different spring config files were using spring 25 to facilitate the different environments

Using XSD schema validation for XPath queries,"im using the following code to create a domdocument and validate it against an external xsd file 
 php

xmlpath  xmlsomefilexml
xsdpath  xsdsomeschemaxsd
    
doc  new domdocument
docloadxmlfilegetcontentsxmlpath libxmlnoblanks

if docschemavalidatexsdpath 
    throw new invalidxmlfileexception

 
 update 2 rewritten question 
 this works fine meaning that if the xml doesnt match the definitions of xsd it will throw a meaningful exception 
 now i want to retrieve information from the domdocument using xpath it works fine aswell however from this point on the domdocument is completely detached from the xsd for example if i have a  domnode  i cannot know whether it is of type  simpletype  or type  complextype  i can check whether the node has child  haschild  nodes but this is not the same also there is tons of information more in the xsd like min and max number of occurrence etc 
 the question really is do i have to query the xsd myself or is there a programmatic way of asking those kind of questions ie is this  domnode  a complex or simple type 
 in  another post  it was suggested to process the schema using a real schema processor and then use its api to ask questions about the contents of the schema does xpath has an api to retrieve information of the xsd or is there a different convenient way with domdocument 
 for the record the original question 
 now i wanted to proceed to parse information from the domdocument using xpath to increase the integrity of my data im storing to a database and giving meaningful error message to the client i wanted to constantly use the schema information to validate the queries ie i wanted to validate fetched childnodes against allowed child nodes defined in the xsd i wanted to that by using xpath on the xsd document 
 however i sumbled across  this post  it basically sais it is a kind of kirky way to that yourself and you should rather use a real schema processor and use its api to make the queries if i understand that right im using a real schema processor with  schemavalidate  but what is meant by using its api 
 i kind of guessed already im not using the schema in a correct way but i have no idea how to research a proper usage 
 the question 
 if i use  schemavalidate  on the domdocument is that a onetime validation true or false or is it tied to the domdocument for longer then precisely can i use the validation also for adding nodes somehow or can i use it to select nodes im interested in as suggested by the referenced so post 
 update 
 the question was rated unclear so i want to try again say i would like to add a node or edit a node value can i use the schema provided in the xsd so that i can validate the user input originally in order to do that i wanted to query the xsd manually with another xpath instance to get the specs for a certain node but as suggested in the linked article this is not best practice so the question would be does the dom lib offer any api to make such a validation 
 maybe im overthinking it maybe i just add the node and run the validation again and see wherewhy it breaks in that case the answer of the custom error handling would be correct can you confirm

How to create a YAML build pipeline in azure devops for xamarin projects with referenced dot net projects,"i recently moved my sources to azure devops to use cdci and all the other cool stuff
now i created my first build pipeline to build the android part of my xamarin project but i end up getting an error message that a resource of a referenced project could not be found and i shall do a package restore and try again
now since i have azure hosted build agents and not self hosted i have no ways of setting the agent up properly before doing the build
but i guess there should be some way to properly configure the build pipeline to do all the necessary stuff
its just that i have no clue what i should add to my yaml file in order to fix this stuff

 also there are a lot classes and structures with double field so in instances of some classes i set specified  true in another cases i do not set specified  true after the log was fixed i see the problem

Tensorflow seq2seq multidimensional regression,"edit  i edited my code to make seq2seq tutorialexercises here they are 
 httpsgithubcomguillaumechevalierseq2seqsignalprediction 
 
 i try to do a sequencetosequence seq2seq regression with multidimensional inputs and outputs i tried something which yields the following loss over time  
 
 the model completely fails to learn to predict a sinus cloned on every input and output dimensions even if i try a very small learning rate  
 the tensorflow loss function built for rnns seems to address the cases where we directly want to train labels or words embeddings so i tried to compute the loss myself regarding that i dont know how we should deal with the decinp decoder input variable what i try to do seems not already done in tensorflow yet especially simple conceptually speaking see title  
 here is the tensor graph  
 
 there are some things on the graph i would not have expected such as the link between the rmsprop optimiser and the basicrnnseq2seq  
 here is what i tried yet

What is the best way to stop people hacking the PHP-based highscore table of a Flash game,"im talking about an action game with no upper score limit and no way to verify the score on the server by replaying moves etc  
 what i really need is the strongest encryption possible in flashphp and a way to prevent people calling the php page other than through my flash file i have tried some simple methods in the past of making multiple calls for a single score and completing a checksum  fibonacci sequence etc and also obfuscating the swf with amayeta swf encrypt but they were all hacked eventually 
 thanks to stackoverflow responses i have now found some more info from adobe   httpwwwadobecomdevnetflashplayerarticlessecureswfapps12html  and  httpsgithubcommikechambersas3corelib   which i think i can use for the encryption not sure this will get me around cheatengine though 
 i need to know the best solutions for both as2 and as3 if they are different 
 the main problems seem to be things like tamperdata and livehttp headers but i understand there are more advanced hacking tools as well  like cheatengine thanks mark webster

Swift 5 & iOS 13 UISearchController wrong presenting and dismissing behaviour,"while i was updating my project to ios 13 i faced with unusual issue

When should I use DO CONCURRENT and when OpenMP?,"i am aware of  this  and  this  but i ask again as the first link is pretty old now and the second link did not seem to reach a conclusive answer has any consensus developed 
 my problem is simple 
 i have a  do  loop that has elements that  may  be run concurrently which method do i use  
 below is code to generate particles on a simple cubic lattice  
 
 npart  is the number of particles 
 npartedge    npartface  are that along an edge and a face respectively 
 space  is the lattice spacing  
 rx   ry   rz  are position arrays 
 x   y   z  are temporary variables to decide positon on lattice 
 
 note the difference that xy and z have to be arrays in the concurrent case but not so in the openmp case because they can be defined as being private 
 so do i use  do concurrent  which as i understand from the links above uses simd  
 do concurrent i  1 npart
    xi  moduloi1 npartedge
    rxi  spacexi
    yi  modulo  i1  npartedge  npartedge
    ryi  spaceyi
    zi  i1  npartface
    rzi  spacezi
end do
 
 or do i use openmp 
 omp parallel defaultshared privatexyz
omp do
do i  1 npart
    x  moduloi1 npartedge
    rxi  spacex
    y  modulo  i1  npartedge  npartedge
    ryi  spacey
    z  i1  npartface
    rzi  spacez
end do
omp end do

Eclipse - How can I change a 'Project Facet' from Tomcat 6 to Tomcat 5.5?,"eclipse 34 ganymede 
 i have an existing dynamic web application project in eclipse when i created the project i specified default configuration for apache tomcat v6 under the configuration drop down 
 its a month or 2 down the line and i would now like to change the configuration to tomcat v55 this will be the version of tomcat on the production server 
 i have tried the following steps without success 
 
 i selected  targeted runtimes  under the project  properties 
the  tomcat v55  option was disabled and the ui displayed this message 
 if the runtime you want to select is not displayed or is disabled you may need to uninstall one or more of the currently installed project facets   
 i then clicked on the  uninstall facets  link 
under the  runtimes  tab only  tomcat 6  displayed 
for  dynamic web module  i selected version  24  in place of  25  
under the  runtimes  tab  tomcat 55  now displayed 
however the ui now displayed this message 
 cannot change version of project facet dynamic web module to 24 
the  finish  button was disabled  so i reached a deadend 
 
 i can successfully create a new project with a tomcat v55 configuration for some reason though it will not let me downgrade an existing project 
 as a workaround i created a new project and copied the source files from the old project nonetheless the workaround was fairly painful and somewhat clumsy 
 can anyone explain how i can downgrade the project configuration from tomcat 6 to tomcat 5 or perhaps shed some light on why this happened

How exactly does Ray share data to workers?,"there are many simple tutorials and also so questions and answers out there which claim that ray somehow shares data with the workers but none of these go into the exact details of what gets shared how on which os 
 for example in this so answer  httpsstackoverflowcoma562870121382437  an np array gets serialised into the shared object store and then used by several workers all accessing the same data code copied from that answer 
 import numpy as np
import ray

rayinit

rayremote
def workerfuncdata i
     do work this function will have readonly access to
     the data array
    return 0

data  npzeros107
 store the large array in shared memory once so that it can be accessed
 by the worker tasks without creating copies
dataid  rayputdata

 run workerfunc 10 times in parallel this will not create any copies
 of the array the tasks will run in separate processes
resultids  
for i in range10
    resultidsappendworkerfuncremotedataid i

 get the results
results  raygetresultids
 
 the  rayputdata  call puts the serialised representation of the data into the shared object store and passes back a handleid for it 
 then when  workerfuncremotedataid i  is invoked the  workerfunc  gets passed the deserialised data 
 but what exactly happens in between clearly the  dataid  is used to locate the serialised version of data and deserialise it 
 q1  when the data gets deserialised does this always create a copy of the original data i would think yes but i am not sure 
 once the data has been deserialised it gets passed to a worker now if the same data needs to get passed to another worker there are two possibilities 
 q2  when an object that has already been deserialised gets passed to a worker will it be via another copy or that exact same object if it is the exact same object is this using the standard shared memory approach to share data between processes on linux this would mean copyonwrite so does this mean that as soon as the object is written to another copy of it is created 
 q3  some tutorialsanswers seem to indicate that the overhead of deserialising and sharing data between workers is very different depending on the type of data numpy versus nonnumpy so what are the details there why is numpy data shared more efficiently and is this still efficient when the client tries to write to that numpy array which i think would always create a local copy for the process

Bursty writes to SD/USB stalling my time-critical apps on embedded Linux,"im working on an embedded linux project that interfaces an arm9 to a hardware video encoder chip and writes the video out to sd card or usb stick the software architecture involves a kernel driver that reads data into a pool of buffers and a userland app that writes the data to a file on the mounted removable device 
 i am finding that above a certain data rate around 750kbytesec i start to see the userland videowriting app stalling for maybe half a second about every 5 seconds this is enough to cause the kernel driver to run out of buffers  and even if i could increase the number of buffers the video data has to be synchronised ideally within 40ms with other things that are going on in real time between these 5 second lag spikes the writes complete well within 40ms as far as the app is concerned  i appreciate theyre buffered by the os 
 i think this lag spike is to do with the way linux is flushing data out to disk  i note that pdflush is designed to wake up every 5s my understanding is that this would be what does the writing as soon as the stall is over the userland app is able to quickly service and write the backlog of buffers that didnt overflow 
 i think the device im writing to has reasonable ultimate throughput copying a 15mb file from a memory fs and waiting for sync to complete and the usb sticks light to stop flashing gave me a write speed of around 27mbytessec 
 im looking for two kinds of clues 
 
 how can i stop the bursty writing from stalling my app  perhaps process priorities realtime patches or tuning the filesystem code to write continuously rather than burstily 
 how can i make my apps aware of what is going on with the filesystem in terms of write backlog and throughput to the cardstick i have the ability to change the video bitrate in the hardware codec on the fly which would be much better than dropping frames or imposing an artificial cap on maximum allowed bitrate 
 
 some more info this is a 200mhz arm9 currently running a montavista 2610based kernel 
 updates 
 mounting the filesystem sync causes throughput to be much too poor
 the removable media is fatfat32 formatted and must be as the purpose of the design is that the media can be plugged into any windows pc and read
 regularly calling sync or fsync say every second causes regular stalls and unacceptably poor throughput
 i am using write and openowronly  ocreat  otrunc rather than fopen etc

Managing large user databases for single-signon,"how would you implement a system with the following objectives 
 
 manage authentication
authorization for
 hundreds of thousands  of  existing users  currently tightly integrated with a 3rd party vendors application we want to bust these users out into something we manage and make our apps work against it plus our 3rd party vendors work against it 
 manage profile information linked to those users 
 must be able to be accessed from any number of web applications on just about any platform windows nix php aspc pythondjango et cetera 
 
 here some sample implementations 
 
 ldapad server to manage everything use custom schema for all profile data  everything can authenticate against ldapad and we can store all sorts of acls and profile data in a custom schema 
 use ldapad for authentication only tie ldap users to a most robust profileauthorization server using some sort of traditional database mssqlpostgresqlmysql or document based db couchdb simpledb et cetera  use ldap for authorization then hit the db for more advanced stuff 
 use a traditional database relational or document for everything 
 
 are any of these three the best are there other solutions which fit the objectives above and are easier to implement 
  i should add that almost all applications that will be authenticating against the user database will be under our control  the lone few outsiders will be the applications were removing the current user database from and perhaps 1 or 2 others  nothing so broad as to need an openid server 
 its also important to know that a lot of these users have had these accounts for  58 years and know their logins and passwords et cetera

How to guarantee 64-bit writes are atomic?,"when can 64bit writes be guaranteed to be atomic when programming in c on an intel x86based platform in particular an intelbased mac running macosx 104 using the intel compiler  for example

  a bunch of other timeconsuming stuff happens 
y  0x12345678abcdefull

Is there anyway to define an undefined object in Visual Studio intellisense?,"lets say i have a controller in angularjs

 however in my intellisense file i can dynamically inject userservice to get its functions like this

 now if i have a global variable or function variable defined as  userservice    and inside my controller function i type  userservice  i will get a pop up of all the functions in the service but if i dont have it defined since it is interpreted as  undefined  by intellisense it cant show me the options even though  statementcompletion  is working as seen in the javascript language service console

Emojis messing with obj-c's sizeWithFont math,"in a  uitableview  that needs to display a long list of chatlike conversations often containing emojis a size calculation error occurs 
 my problem is that if a string is just the right length and i use  sizewithfont  i on my first measurement using  sizewithfont  get an incorrect length of the string causing a linebreak 
 i assume that it is because the string  is broader than the actual smiley icon 
 the evidence can be seen here  
 
 now over at some other stacks some claim that  sizewithfont  will only account for the string not the emoji which for me doesnt make sense since it gets it right eventually 
 but they propose using sizetofit instead so i decided to give it a go 
 
 bam same result 
 does anyone know how to counter this  is there a  boolean  to check if label is done being emojiprocessed so i can skip that call  
 running the same line twice does nothing it seems the view needs to be drawn before  sizewithfont  realises its mistake

Manage Roles and Assign Permissions to Roles - Symfony,"im building an admin panel in symfony 3 based on roles  permissions each admin will be assigned a roleor multiple roles and then he will be able to do things based on the permissions assigned to that role 
 
 to give you an idea heres an example 
 
 admin panel has the functionality to add users edit users and delete users 
 i created a role  usermanagementwithoutdelete  which has permission to  usercreate  and  useredit  
 i created  usermanagementwithdelete  role which has permission to  usercreate   useredit  and  userdelete 
 so now admin with role  usermanagementwithdelete  can  add   edit  and  delete  the users where as admin with role  usermanagementwithoutdelete  can only  add  and  edit  users but cannot delete them 
 
 
 i searched and found out about  fosuserbundle  and   acl  some  recommended acl  while others say its better to  use fosuserbunder 
 i also read the documentation of fosuserbunder and how it store roles in  roles  column something like  a1i0s10roleadmin  but there is nothing mentioned about permissions so here are my queries 
 
 im confused between the two which one should i use 
 if i use  fosuserbunder  how to manage permissions

Redis queue vs MSMQ,"for a long time we were using msmq and redis queue  iredislist 
couple of month ago we started trying redis pubsub  
 our application has more than twenty services that read messages from queue or subscribe to channels with redis 
we also have more than ten queues that we send messages to them
the application is multithreaded 
 so what do i want from you 
 now we have some time to spend on deciding what kind of the queues above do we want to use and what do we want to replace with a different kind of queue

How to prevent SIGPIPEs (or handle them properly),"i have a small server program that accepts connections on a tcp or local unix socket reads a simple command and depending on the command sends a reply

"What does ""release sequence"" mean?","i dont understand why will be problems without  release sequence  if we have 2 threads in the example below we have only 2 operations on the atomic variable  count   count  is decremented sequently as shown in the output 
 from  c concurrency in action  by  antony williams  
 
 i mentioned that you could get a  synchronizeswith relationship  between a  store  to an atomic variable and a  load  of that atomic variable from another thread even when there’s a sequence of  readmodifywrite  operations between the  store  and the  load  provided all the operations are suitably tagged if the store is tagged with  memoryorderrelease   memoryorderacqrel  or  memoryorderseqcst  and the load is tagged with  memoryorderconsume   memoryorderacquire  or  memoryorderseqcst  and each operation in the chain loads the value written by the previous operation then the chain of operations constitutes a  release sequence  and the initial store  synchronizeswith  for  memoryorderacquire  or  memoryorderseqcst  or is  dependencyorderedbefore  for  memoryorderconsume  the final load any atomic readmodifywrite operations in the chain can have any memory ordering even  memoryorderrelaxed  
 to see what this means release sequence and why it’s important consider an  atomicint  being used as a count of the number of items in a shared queue as in the following listing 
 one way to handle things would be to have the thread that’s producingthe data store the items in a shared buffer and then do  countstorenumberofitems memoryorderrelease   1  to let the other threads know that data is available the threads consuming the queue items might then do  countfetchsub1memory orderacquire   2  to claim an item from the queue prior to actually reading the shared buffer  4  once the count becomes zero there are no more items and the thread must wait  3

 if there’s  one consumer thread  this is fine the  fetchsub  is a read with  memoryorderacquire  semantics and the store had  memoryorderrelease  semantics so the store synchronizeswith the load and the thread can read the item from the buffer  
 if there are  two threads  reading the second  fetchsub  will see the value written by the first and not the value written by the store without the rule about the  release sequence  this second thread wouldn’t have a  happensbefore relationship  with the first thread and it wouldn’t be safe to read the shared buffer unless the first  fetchsub  also had  memoryorderrelease  semantics which would introduce unnecessary synchronization between the two consumer threads without the  release sequence  rule or  memoryorderrelease  on the  fetchsub  operations there would be nothing to require that the stores to the  queuedata  were visible to the second consumer and you would have a data race 
 
 what does he mean that both threads should see the value of  count  is  20  but in my output  count  is sequently decremented in threads 
 
 thankfully the first  fetchsub  does participate in the release sequence and so the  store  synchronizeswith the second  fetchsub  there’s still no synchronizeswith relationship between the two consumer threads this is shown in figure 57 the dotted lines in figure 57 show the release sequence and the solid lines show the  happensbefore relationships

What is the closest thing to Slime for Scheme?,"i do most of my development in common lisp but there are some moments when i want to switch to scheme while reading  lisp in small pieces  when i want to play with continuations or when i want to do some scripting in gauche for example in such situations my main source of discomfort is that i dont have slime yes you may call me an addict 
 what is schemes closest counterpart to slime specifically i am most interested in 
 
 emacs integration this point is obvious  
 decent tab completion ideally cwcc tab should expand to callwithcurrentcontinuation it may be even symboltable based ie it doesnt have to notice a function i defined in a  let  at once 
 function argument hints in the minibuffer if i have typed  map   cursor position is indicated by    id like to see  map predicate  lists  in the minibuffer 
 sending forms to the interpreter 
 integration with a debugger 
 
 i have ordered the features by descending importance 
 my scheme implementations of choice are

 ikarus 
 gauche 
 bigloo

"Whats the correct way, using ""init"" or ""didmove""?","language swift 30  ide  xcode 80 beta 2  project  ios game spritekit 
 i create a game for ios and i know apple is really strict with their rules to accept the appgame so i want to know which is the correct way to setup a game 
 i learned from google to create a new spritekit project and do the following setup  
 in  gameviewcontrollerswift  clear viewdidload and add all this  
 override func viewdidload 
    superviewdidload
    let skview  selfview as skview

    override initsize cgsize 
        superinitsize size
         add all the code of the game here
    


 
 and develop my game inside override init 
 but i think thats actually wrong to start the game with init and that the right way is to use the didmove method so should the code be written inside here  
 override func didmoveto view skview 
    code

 
 does anyone know which one is the correct way and why also if its wrong the way i do it can you explain me how to use didmove method 
 dont know if this is a silly question just bothered me that using init is wrong and wanted to ask if someone knows more about this

Migrate/create HA-Singleton to jboss 7,"ive been using deployhasingleton folder in jboss as 6 this allowed me to create a singleton bean that is used to control business information requests from the cluster nodes these methods are synchronized in order to control the concurrency between nodes the same data cannot be in different nodes 
 now that im migrating to the jboss 7 and since that deployhasingleton folder disappeared ive been following the official examples 
 
 cluster link 
 cluster link 2 
 
 the problem is that theses examples are too trivial and i couldnt understand where i can place the business logic methods 
so i tried to place that logic in the singletonservice which implements service myinterface 
 and ive modified the getvalue method to the following 
 override
    public myinterface getvalue throws illegalstateexception
            illegalargumentexception 

        return this

         else 
            throw new illegalstateexceptionservice   groupdistributorservicesingletonservicename   not found
        
    
 
 i doubt that this is the correct approach and second this appears to work in the node that contains the master singleton service however in other nodes it locks when calling the singleton service and i get a timeout

What kind of prefix do you use for member variables?,"no doubt its essential for understanding code to give member variables a prefix so that they can easily be distinguished from normal variables 
 but what kind of prefix do you use 
 i have been working on projects where we used  m  as prefix on other projects we used an underscore only which i personally dont like because an underscore only is not demonstrative enough 
 on another project we used a long prefix form that also included the variable type  mul  for example is the prefix of a  m ember variable of type  u nsigned  l ong 
 now let me know what kind of prefix you use and please give a reason for it

Where should I clone into when cloning a python packages from github?,"problem the package i want to install is outdated on pip and conda doesnt have it in the repo so when i install a python package from github using  
 git clone packageurl 
cd packagename
python setuppy
 
 should i download the package from within the directory that is the directory in which conda or pip usually would install my package for example should i run git clone from within 
 usershomeanacondalibpython27sitepackages
usershomeanacondalibsitepython
 
 or can i just run git clone from whatever directory i happen to be in   
 the concern is that i download from git in something like usershomedownloads and then when i run the setuppy file i would only install within the usershomedownloads directory and then when i import i wouldnt be able to find the package 
 accepted answer i can run the git clone command in terminal from within any directory then i can change directory into the newly established directory for the package that i cloned and run the setuppy script running the setuppy script should automatically install the package within the sitepackages of whatever python is being used when python is invoked i hope this helps someone overly anxious about running setuppy files

Update VERY LARGE PostgreSQL database table efficiently,"i have a very large database table in postgresql and a column like copied every new row starts uncopied and will later be replicated to another thing by a background programm there is an partial index on that table btreeid where replicated0 the background programm does a select for at most 2000 entries limit 2000 works on them and then commits the changes in one transaction using 2000 prepared sqlcommands 
 now the problem ist that i want to give the user an option to reset this replicatedvalue make it all zero again 
 an update table set replicated0 
 is not possible 
 
 it takes very much time 
 it duplicates the size of the tabel because of mvcc 
 it is done in one transaction it either fails or goes through 
 
 i actually dont need transactionfeatures for this case if the system goes down it shall process only parts of it 
 several other problems
doing an  
 update set replicated0 where id 10000 and id20000
 
 is also bad it does a sequential scan all over the whole table which is too slow
if it werent doing that it would still be slow because it would be too many seeks 
 what i really need is a way of going through all rows changing them and not being bound to a giant transaction 
 strangely an 
 update table 
  set replicated0 
where id in select id from table where replicated limit 10000
 
 is also slow although it should be a good thing go through the table in diskorder 
 note that in that case there was also an index that covered this 
 an update limit like mysql is unavailable for postgresql 
 btw the real problem is more complicated and were talking about an embedded system here that is already deployed so remote schema changes are difficult but possible
its postgresql 74 unfortunately 
 the amount of rows im talking about is eg 90000000 the size of the databse can be several dozend gigabytes 
 the database itself only contains 5 tables one is a very large one
but that is not bad design because these embedded boxes only operate with one kind of entity its not an erpsystem or something like that 
 any ideas

How do I remove the passphrase for the SSH key without having to create a new key?,"i set a passphrase when creating a new ssh key on my laptop but as i realise now this is quite painful when you are trying to commit  git  and  svn  to a remote location over ssh many times in an hour

"Using Visual Studio 2008 to Assemble, Link, Debug, and Execute MASM 6.11 Assembly Code","i would like to use visual studio 2008 to the greatest extent possible while effectively compilinglinkingbuildingetc code as if all these build processes were being done by the tools provided with masm 611 the exact version of masm does not matter so long as its within the 6x range as that is what my college is using to teach 16bit assembly 
 i have done some research on the subject and have come to the conclusion that there are several options 
 
 reconfigure vs to call the masm 611 executables with the same flags etc as masm 611 would natively do 
 create intermediary batch files to be called by vs to then invoke the proper commands for masms linker etc 
 reconfigure vss builtin build toolsrules assembler linker etc to provide an environment identical to the one used by masm 611 
 
 option 2 was brought up when i realized that the options available in vss external tools interface may be insufficient to correctly invoke masms build tools thus a batch file to interpret vss strict method of passing arguments might be helpful as a lot of my learning about how to get this working involved my manually calling mlexe linkexe etc from the command prompt 
 below are several links that may prove useful in answering my question please keep in mind that i have read them all and none are the actual solution i can only hope my specifying masm 611 doesnt prevent anyone from contributing a perhaps more generalized answer 
 similar method used to option 2 but users on the thread are not contactable 
 httpwwwcodegurucomforumarchiveindexphpt284051html 
also i have my doubts about the necessity of an intermediary batch file 
 out of date explanation to my question 
 httpwwwcsfiuedudowneytcop3402masmaulhtml 
 probably the closest thing ive come to a definitive solution but refers to a suite of tools from something besides masm also uses a batch file 
 httpwwwkipirvinecomasmgettingstartedindexhtm16bit 
 i apologize if my terminology for the tools used in each step of the code  exe process is off but since im trying to reproduce the entirety of steps in between completion of writing the code and generating an executable i dont think it matters much

A PDF viewer for PDF with large vector images on linux?,"i need to view some pdf with large vector images they can be really large on linux i am on debian wheesy i need also to zoom on theses images with more than 400 infinite zoom would be great more than 800 would be good i have tested several pdf viewers but they have the following problems

Choose adapter dynamically depending on librarie(s) installed,"i am designing a library that has adapters that supports a widerange of libraries i want the library to dynamically choose which ever adapter that has the library it uses installed on the machine when importing specific classes 
 the goal is to be able to change the library that the program depends on without having to make modifications to the code this particular feature is for handling rabbitmq connections as we have had a lot of problems with  pika  we want to be able to change to a different library eg  pyampq  or  rabbitpy  without having to change the underlying code  
 i was thinking of implementing something like this in the  initpy  file of   servicelibrarysimple  
 try
    import pika  is pika installed
    from servicelibrarysimplesynchronous import publisher
    from servicelibrarysimplesynchronous import consumer
except importerror
    import ampq  is ampq installed
    from servicelibrarysimplealternative import publisher
    from servicelibrarysimplealternative import consumer
 
 then when the user imports the library  
 from servicelibrarysimple import publisher
 
 the underlying layer looks something like this 
 alternativepy 
 import amqp

class publisherobject
    

class consumerobject
         
 
 synchronouspy 
 import pika

class publisherobject
    

class consumerobject
        
 
 this would automatically pick the second one when the first one is not installed 
 is there a better way of implementing something like this if anyone could link a libraryadapter with a similar implementation that would be helpful as well 
 edit   
 what would be the cleanest way to implement something like this in the future i would also like to be able to change the default preference ultimately i may just settle for using the library installed as i can control that but it would be a nice feature to have  
 alexanders suggestion is interesting but i would like to know if there is a cleaner way 
 edit2 
 the original example was simplified each module may contain multiple types of imports eg consumer and publisher

Updating RecyclerView item ProgressBar without calling notifyItemChanged(int) on adapter,"i am trying to update a progressbar which is the part of one of the recyclerview items i know i can do it in two ways 
 method 1 by refreshing the item row by calling notifyitemchangedposition 
 method 2 by accessing the view using the method findviewbyposition on layoutmananger object  
 but unluckily none of them are working in my case  
 if i use the first one the whole item will get repainted the background color of the recyclerview is gray and the item is white so the user can notice the whole item refresh  
 if i try the second one i will end up with problems while scrolling

Can I protect against SQL injection by escaping single-quote and surrounding user input with single-quotes?,"i realize that parameterized sql queries is the optimal way to sanitize user input when building queries that contain user input but im wondering what is wrong with taking user input and escaping any single quotes and surrounding the whole string with single quotes heres the code 
 ssanitizedinput    replacesinput    
 
 any singlequote the user enters is replaced with double singlequotes which eliminates the users ability to end the string so anything else they may type such as semicolons percent signs etc will all be part of the string and not actually executed as part of the command   
 we are using microsoft sql server 2000 for which i believe the singlequote is the only string delimiter and the only way to escape the string delimiter so there is no way to execute anything the user types in 
 i dont see any way to launch an sql injection attack against this but i realize that if this were as bulletproof as it seems to me someone else would have thought of it already and it would be common practice   
 whats wrong with this code is there a way to get an sql injection attack past this sanitization technique  sample user input that exploits this technique would be very helpful 
 
 update 
 i still dont know of any way to effectively launch a sql injection attack against this code a few people suggested that a backslash would escape one singlequote and leave the other to end the string so that the rest of the string would be executed as part of the sql command and i realize that this method would work to inject sql into a mysql database but in sql server 2000 the only way that ive been able to find to escape a singlequote is with another singlequote backslashes wont do it 
 and unless there is a way to stop the escaping of the singlequote none of the rest of the user input will be executed because it will all be taken as one contiguous string 
 i understand that there are better ways to sanitize input but im really more interested in learning why the method i provided above wont work if anyone knows of any specific way to mount a sql injection attack against this sanitization method i would love to see it

iOS *Cell Performance: Autolayout vs Frame?,"im using autolayout for cells uitableviewcell and uicollectionviewcell but noticed a significant performance drawback when the cells are reused and i wonder what could i do to improve it 
 maybe it is due to the way i createconfigure cell in my app i need to show books as cells and different book genres have different layout but i only have one bookcell i reconfigure constraints when the cell is createdreused for a particular book based on the books genre 
 from my understanding in my case autolayout  should  be slower than fixed frame as the steps are as follows 
 autolayout 
 
 remove current constraints 
 readd constraints depending on books genre 
 set all labels  image views for the book 
 
 i think internally at step 2 ios will rerun the constraints solver and at step 3 will readjust constraints ie rerun the solver to satisfy all labels and image views with text and images set 
 fixedlayout 
 have a list of different frames for labels image views for different genre
1 reset all labels image views frames
2 set labels text and image views images 
 it takes me some time to convert all autolayout cells to use fixed frames and the things i can think of in order to improve the performance are 
 
 duplicate the generic bookcell and make one cell for each genre 
 set all labels image views  before  setup constraints 
 not too sure about this should i add autolayout constraints in  updateconstraints  method or in the initializer eg  initwithtableviewcellstylereusableidentifier

Access to private static function during static member initialization,"i have a class with a static member this will be initialized using a private static function of the same class

 my question is because of which rule is this allowed clearly the commented part does not work because i am not allowed to access a private function from outside the class so why is the initialization of the private static member during startup a special case and on a side note what is the intention of this rule is it to allow this exact case

Login with AAD MSAL - Login is already in progress,"i have a aspnet website that uses msal to login 
 the issue i keep having is that whenever the user logs in then logs out again the user is redirected to a logout page
this page implements the  new msaluseragentapplicationmsalconfiglogout  function and redirects the user back to the login page 
 this all works perfectly the login page will then automatically redirect the user back to the aad login page 
 if the user then decides to login again the result of  mymsalobjectgetaccount  returns null and an error occurs that mentions the following 
 
 clientautherror logininprogress error during login call  login is already in progress 
 
 at first i used one js file to handle log in  logout i then realised that that probably wasnt he best solution as it attempted a login on load 
 so i decided to split them up into two separate js files but this hasnt fixed my problem

 edit 
 some extra details
ive now made it so that users must click on a button before being redirected to microsoft to login 
 the above unfortunately still applies after logging in succesfully for the first time  logging out a secondary login attempt will not yield a value in the function  getaccount  even though it works perfectly the first time 
 the error i get after ive logged in is still the same namely 
 clientautherror logininprogress error during login call  login is already in progress 
 even though i just logged in 
 does anyone have a solution 
 edit 2 
 there is a little bit of progress sort of ive been able to fix the error above by changing way i log the user out 
 the config file is now a definition within document ready  ive moved the log out function in there aswell 
 although i now face a new challenge 
 refused to display httpsloginmicrosoftonlinecom in a frame because it set xframeoptions to deny
 
 and im not entirely sure if this is a step forward or backwards the reproduction scenario remains the same you log in then you log out  back in again when microsoft sends the user back to the login page i get the error mentioned in this edit but i dont get this error on the 1st login attempt

Float values behaving differently across the release and debug builds,"my application is generating different floating point values when i compile it in release mode and in debug mode the only reason that i found out is i save a binary trace log and the one from the release build is ever so slightly off from the debug build it looks like the bottom two bits of the 32 bit float values are different about 12 of the cases 
 would you consider this difference to be a bug or would this type of difference be expected would this be a compiler bug or an internal library bug 
 for example 
 leftpos and spacing are defined floating point values
float defx
int xpos

Local Storage Cross Domain - Safari disables it by default,"the issue  
 i have used github project of ofir dagan storing cross domain local storage 
 it implements html5 local storage
 httpsgithubcomofirdagancrossdomainlocalstorage 
 
 the problem   
 safari doesnt allow third party cookies by default other browsers allow it 
 safari privacy preferences are 
 
 the default is allow from websites i visit 
 i read about these settings 
 
 always block   block all firstparty cookies and block all thirdparty cookies 
 allow from current website only   allow all firstparty cookies and block all thirdparty cookies 
 allow from websites i visit   allow all firstparty cookies and block all thirdparty cookies unless that third party was a first party at one time based on current cookies and browsing history 
 always allow   allow all firstparty cookies and allow all thirdparty cookies 
 
 
 solution i have tried  
 local storage with an iframe pixel  i think its no longer works on safari   is there any workaround to set third party cookie in iframe for safari 
 
 i think that there is a way to share local storage between first party and third party sites on safari facebookcom and bookingcom share data between different domains 
 i succeeded to achieve it by removing the api and writing it by myself but i dont want to remove the api and implement it by myself hope that there is a small fix in order to support safari

Best way to compare 2 XML documents in Java,"im trying to write an automated test of an application that basically translates a custom message format into an xml message and sends it out the other end  ive got a good set of inputoutput message pairs so all i need to do is send the input messages in and listen for the xml message to come out the other end 
 when it comes time to compare the actual output to the expected output im running into some problems  my first thought was just to do string comparisons on the expected and actual messages  this doenst work very well because the example data we have isnt always formatted consistently and there are often times different aliases used for the xml namespace and sometimes namespaces arent used at all 
 i know i can parse both strings and then walk through each element and compare them myself and this wouldnt be too difficult to do but i get the feeling theres a better way or a library i could leverage  
 so boiled down the question is 
 given two java strings which both contain valid xml how would you go about determining if they are semantically equivalent  bonus points if you have a way to determine what the differences are

"Weird MSC 8.0 error: ""The value of ESP was not properly saved across a function call...""","we recently attempted to break apart some of our visual studio projects into libraries and everything seemed to compile and build fine in a test project with one of the library projects as a dependency however attempting to run the application gave us the following nasty runtime error message 
 
 runtime check failure 0  the value of esp was not properly saved across a function call this is usually a result of calling a function pointer declared with a different calling convention 
 
 we have never even specified calling conventions cdecl etc for our functions leaving all the compiler switches on the default i checked and the project settings are consistent for calling convention across the library and test projects 
 update one of our devs changed the basic runtime checks project setting from both rtc1 equiv to rtcsu to default and the runtime vanished leaving the program running apparently correctly i do not trust this at all was this a proper solution or a dangerous hack

C#: Convert COMP-3 Packed Decimal to Human-Readable Value,"i have a series of ascii flat files coming in from a mainframe to be processed by a c application a new feed has been introduced with a packed decimal comp3 field which needs to be converted to a numerical value

 whats more the fields are being read as strings i may have the flexibility to work around this part ie a stream of some sort but the business will give me pushback 
 the requirement read convert from hex to ascii but clearly that didnt yield the correct values  any help would be appreciated it need not be languagespecific as long as you can explain the logic of the conversion process

What is the best buffer size when using BinaryReader to read big files (>1 GB)?,"im reading binary files and here is a sample

    byte buffer  new byte161024
    int read
    while read  inputreadbuffer 0 bufferlength  0
    
        
    


 
 obviously the buffer size 161024 has a great role in performance ive read that it depends on the io technology  sata   ssd   scsi  etc and also the fragment size of the partition which file exists on it we can define during the formatting the partition 
 but here is the question
 is there any formula or best practice to define the buffer size  right now im defining based on trialanderror 
 edit 
ive tested the application on my server with different buffer sizes and i get the best performance with 409525616 16 mb 4096 is 4 seconds slower 
 here are some older posts which are very helpful but i cant still get the reason

implicit operator using interfaces,"i have a generic class that im trying to implement implicit type casting for  while it mostly works it wont work for interface casting  upon further investigation i found that there is a compiler error userdefined conversion from interface that applies  while i understand that this should be enforced in some cases what im trying to do does seem like a legitimate case 
 heres an example 
 public class foot where t  ibar

    private readonly t instance

    public foot instance

fooibar foofrominterfacebar  intefacereferencetobar  doesnt work
 
 does anyone know a workaround or can anyone explain in a satisfactory way why i shuouldnt be able to cast  interfacereferencetobar  implicitly to  fooibar  since in my case it is not being converted but only contained within foo

it looks like covariance might offer salvation  lets hope the c 40 specification allows for implicit casting of interface types using covariance

How to append to a select box in the WordPress customiser from an API call?,"im working on a wordpress theme and ive added a select box to allow users to select a font for their site i figured id use the google fonts api to grab the list of fonts rather than add all 900andsomething manually but when i call the api im unable to append the returned data as options in the select box

What are the consequences of not closing database connection after an error?,"i have an application that is causing a lot of headaches its a net app connecting to sql server 2005 via a web service the program has grid that is filled by a long running stored procedure that is prone to timing out in the case when it does time out and a sqlexception is thrown there is no execption handling to close the connection 
 what are the actual consequences of this condition i think that the framework or sql server probably takes care of it one way or another but am not sure  
 addition 
the program always works well in the morning but after an hour or so of use it basically stops working the issue isnt that i dont know how to code the connection properly i need to know if these symptoms could be casued by the unclosed connections it is kind of a big deal to change the production code and i would like to know that it is at least possible for this to be the issue 
 conclusion 
i engineered this failure to occur on hundreds of simultaneous connections never was i able reproduce the failure condition in the application environment marked best practices answer as correct thanks everyone

Windows C++ dialog resizer class,"im looking for a really good dialog resizer class that will stretch and shrink individual items as needed as the screen is resized  stephan keil has a good one dlgresizehelper which basically resizes everything by a set ratio but im looking for something smarter

 singleline text boxes should not be stretched vertically 
 buttons should probably stay the same size

 are there such frameworks out there  ive been working on one but something readymade would probably be better 
 follow up im looking at the suggested solutions  many of them require you to go in an anchor each control on the dialog  im looking for something smart that will figure out what the anchors ought to be with the ability to manually anchor if the guesses are wrong  seems like it should be possible  most humans would agree a static text field next to an edit field should be anchored together  guess im almost looking for a little ai here

C++ performance vs. Java/C#,"my understanding is that cc produces native code to run on a particular machine architecture  conversely languages like java and c run on top of a virtual machine which abstracts away the native architecture  logically it would seem impossible for java or c to match the speed of c because of this intermediate step however ive been told that the latest compilers hot spot can attain this speed or even exceed it 
 perhaps this is more of a compiler question than a language question but can anyone explain in plain english how it is possible for one of these virtual machine languages to perform better than a native language

Best way to sandbox Apache on Linux,"i have apache running on a publicfacing debian server and am a bit worried about the security of the installation this is a machine that hosts several freetime hobby projects so none of us who use the machine really have the time to constantly watch for upstream patches stay aware of security issues etc but i would like to keep the bad guys out or if they get in keep them in a sandbox

 my dispatch calls are always

 so for the first instance that would be

toying with the y thread group number numthreads1681 managed to push it to 32 fps

How to avoid delay in Android GCM messages / change heartbeat,"ive been reading many posts regarding a gcm issue that affects some people it seems that in some devicesrouterscarriers the notifications suffer delays ive experienced this issue with my router messages came with a lot of delay on wifi but came instantly when i disabled wifi and connected to the mobile net 
 it seems there is a workaround that can be done from the android app something like increasing the heartbeat that keeps gcm connection alive or so 
 can anyone tell us what should we do to avoid the delay how can we keep the connection with gcm from an android app a code example and where and how to use it would be really helpful 
 this post  explains the problem it says that we could keep the connection alive with a ping every two minutes from the gcm server which is free how can we do that 
 thanks a lot

Slow SoapHttpClientProtocol constructor,"im doing some experiments with microsoft dynamics crm you interact with it through web services and i have added a web reference to my project the web service interface is very rich and the generated referencecs is some 90k loc

    crmservice service  new crmservice
 
profiling reveals that all time is spent in the soaphttpclientprotocol constructor 
 the culprit is apparently the fact that the xml serialization code not included in the 90k loc mentioned above is generated at run time before being jited this happens during the constructor call the wait is rather frustrating when playing around and trying things out 
 ive tried various combinations of sgenexe ngen and xgenplus which takes several hours and generates 500mb of additional code but to no avail ive considered implementing a windows service that have few crmservice instances ready to dish out when needed but that seems excessive

Why does Apache Tomcat handle encoded slashes (%2F) as path separators?,"apache tomcat at least before tomcat 6  see footnote  treats a percentencoded slash 2f in a uri path just like a regular slash ie as a path delimiter 
 so eg the servlets example page of tomcat can be accessed at  
 
 httplocalhost8080examplesservlets  and at 
 httplocalhost8080examples2fservlets 
 
 this does not make sense to me the whole point of percentencoding a reserved character like  is to avoid it being treated as a reserved character in this case a path delimiter in addition to this this behaviour is one cause of the vulnerability  cve20070450  however i assume there must have been a reason for this 
 
 is there any technical reason why tomcat treats ok used to treat 2f as a path delimiter 
 is there some situation where this behaviour is helpful

Linux shared library init & deinit when also using c++ static initializer,"i want to have automated calls to initialize and deinitialize my shared library 
 in my shared library i need some static initialization of c objects among others because of use of third party code eg unittest
when my init function is executed i need to be guaranted that all static initialization of c objects of all linked translation units is done and vice versa for deinit so just the same conditions as the execution of main can expect in a c program 
 ive seen much informations about linux shared library initdeinit eg like 
 automatically executed functions when loading shared libraries

but the provided solutions wont fit my needs in both approaches  attributeconstructor  and even  wlinitfunction name  the init function seems to be called before static initialization of c objects is completely done

 class initanddeinit

    initanddeinit 
         do some initialization
    
    initanddeinit 
         do some cleanup

 but that also wont place the calls to the desired point even with  attributeconstructor65535  
 id tested with gcc 464 473 and 481 464 shows a slightly different behaviour regarding the sorting of  attributeconstructor

Create destinations for all bookmarks in a PDF file with iText API,"id like to write some java code that takes a pdf document and creates named destinations from all of the bookmarks i think the itext api is the easiest way of doing this but i have never used the api before 
 how would you go about writing this sort of code with the itext api  can itext do the parsing needed to manipulate existing pdfs by itself  the kind of manipulations i am thinking of are  
 
 open  
 find bookmarks

Why is there no RAII in .NET?,"being primarily a c developer the absence of  raii resource acquisition is initialization  in java and net has always bothered me the fact that the onus of cleaning up is moved from the class writer to its consumer by means of  try finally  or nets  using  construct  seems to be markedly inferior 
 i see why in java there is no support for raii since all objects are located on the heap and the garbage collector inherently doesnt support deterministic destruction but in net with the introduction of valuetypes  struct  we have the seemingly perfect candidate for raii a value type thats created on the stack has a well defined scope and c destructor semantics can be used however the clr does not permit a valuetype to have a destructor 
 my random searches found one argument that if a valuetype is  boxed  it falls under the jurisdiction of the garbage collector and therefore its destruction becomes nondeterministic 
i feel that this argument isnt strong enough the benefits of raii are big enough to say that a valuetype with a destructor cannot be boxed or used as a class member 
 to cut a long story short my question is  are there any other reasons value types can not be used in order to introduce raii to net  or do you think my argument about raiis obvious advantages are flawed 
 edit  i must have not phrased the question clearly since the first four answers have missed the point i  know  about  finalize  and its nondeterministic characteristics i know about the  using  construct and i feel these two options are inferior to raii  using  is one more thing the consumer of a class must remember how many people forgot to put a  streamreader  in a  using  block my question is a philosophical one about the language design why is it the way it is and can it be improved 
 for instance with a generic deterministically destructible valuetype i can make the  using  and  lock  keywords redundant achievable by library classes

Disabling Timer Coalescing in OSX for a given process,"i have a background application which requires to send a keepalive to another process every 15 seconds  everything works smoothly in osx 107 and 108 but under osx 109 many keepalive notifications are missed sometime up to 3 usually everything works fine for the first 3 or 4 minutes then problems start to occur

Discover what process/query is using oracle temp tablespace,"oracle faq defines temp table space as follows

  will be allocated in a temporary

 anyway long story short is there a way at runtime to ask ruby where a method has been defined something like  whereami foo   that returns  pathtosomefilerb line 45  in this case telling me that it was defined in class string would be unhelpful because it was overloaded by some library

"Pro's of databases like BigTable, SimpleDB","new school datastore paradigms like google bigtable and amazon simpledb are specifically designed for scalability among other things basically disallowing joins and denormalization are the ways this is being accomplished 
 in  this  topic however the consensus seems to be that joins on large tables dont necessarilly have to be too expensive and denormalization is overrated to some extent
why then do these aforementioned systems disallow joins and force everything together in a single table to achieve scalability is it the sheer volumes of data that needs to be stored in these systems many terabytes 
do the general rules for databases simply not apply to these scales
is it because these database types are tailored specifically towards storing many similar objects

Ruby and duck typing: design by contract impossible?,"method signature in java 
 public liststring getfilesinlistfile directories
 
 similar one in ruby 
 def getfilesindirectories
 
 in the case of java the type system gives me information about what the method expects and delivers  in rubys case i have  no  clue what im supposed to pass in or what ill expect to receive 
 in java the object must formally implement the interface  in ruby the object being passed in must respond to whatever methods are called in the method defined here   
 this seems highly problematic 
 
 even with 100 accurate uptodate documentation the ruby code has to essentially expose its implementation breaking encapsulation  oo purity aside this would seem to be a maintenance nightmare 
 the ruby code gives me  no  clue whats being returned i would have to essentially experiment or read the code to find out what methods the returned object would respond to 
 
 not looking to debate static typing vs duck typing but looking to understand how you maintain a production system where you have almost no ability to design by contract 
 update 
 no one has really addressed the exposure of a methods internal implementation via documentation that this approach requires  since there are no interfaces if im not expecting a particular type dont i have to itemize every method i might call so that the caller knows what can be passed in  or is this just an edge case that doesnt really come up

What's a good C memory allocator for embedded systems?,"i have an single threaded embedded application that allocates and deallocates lots and lots of small blocks 3264b the perfect scenario for a cache based allocator and although i could try to write one itll likely be a waste of time and not as well tested and tuned as some solution thats already been on the front lines

"Map-Navigation Project, How is road data generally stored/represented?","navigation systems like the garmin and tomtom have always fascinated me  ive wanted to implement small mapnavigation applications to try out various pathing algorithms and expand on my knowledge of them 
 this is a two part question 
 1 how is map data stored    when you have a network of roads how is this data generally stored  what parts of the data are retained inorder to reproduce a map later  is each road stored as a series of points where it changes direction what kind of file formats is this data stored in are there publically available libraries for easily parsing these files does anyone have specifics on how maproad data is storedrepresented it would be very helpful 
 2 navigationpathing   when doing basic pathing on this map data a la garmin is my assumption correct that it is converted to a directed graph  is each road intersection a vertex with the edge weights the distance between vertexes  this is what i was thinking about doing so i could try some basic well known pathing algorithms and see what i get 
 ive seen  this  publically available map data on the us but im not sure how it is represented and if it is detailed enough for me to be able to build my directed graph out of it

How to use POSIXLY_CORRECT in grep?,"there is a variable  posixlycorrect  in bash 
 
 posixlycorrect 
 if this variable is in the environment when bash starts the shell
  enters posix mode see bash posix mode before reading the startup
  files as if the posix invocation option had been supplied if it is
  set while the shell is running bash enables posix mode as if the
  command 
 set o posix
 
 had been executed 
 
 i was told that some options of  grep  are not posix and so i confirmed in  the open group base specifications issue 6 for  grep  so i checked the  gnu grep manual  and found 
 
 grep  comes with a rich set of options some from posix and some being gnu extensions long option names are always a gnu extension
  even for options that are from posix specifications options that are
  specified by posix under their short names are explicitly marked as
  such to facilitate posixportable programming a few option names are
  provided for compatibility with older or more exotic implementations 
 
 and it also mentions 
 
 22 environment variables 
 the behavior of grep is affected by the following environment variables 
 posixlycorrect 
  if set grep behaves as posix requires otherwise grep behaves more like other gnu programs posix requires that options that follow file names must be treated as file names by default such options are permuted to the front of the operand list and are treated as options also posixlycorrect disables special handling of an invalid bracket expression see invalidbracketexpr 
 
 using the part  long option names are always a gnu extension even for options that are from posix specifications  i said lets try the variable posixlycorrect against that 
 so i did try with something that is not posix 
  echo hello  grep ignorecase hello
hello
 
 but to my surprise it also works setting it 
  echo hello  posixlycorrect1 grep ignorecase hello
hello
 
 what am i doing wrong shouldnt a set posixlycorrect make  grep  not recognize a long option name 
 the same occurs if using an option for example  c  that is not posix

the root cause of failure of login by calling 
 comibmwebspheresecurityauthwssubjectgetrootloginexception 
 the above api exists in serverrootdirlibcomibmwebspheresecurityxyzjar 
 it is because the decompiled sourcecode of the method  getrootloginexception  is 
 public static throwable getrootloginexception
   return null

 
 but in  httpswwwibmcomsupportknowledgecentersseqtp855comibmwebspherejavadocdocwebapidocscomibmwebspheresecurityauthwssubjecthtml 
 ibm claims that 
 
 public static javalangthrowable getrootloginexception 
 this convenient method returns the root login exception caught in the
  system login module if one exists 
 it will extract the exception from the current thread you will get
  what the login module sees as the root exception this could be a
  nested exception you may need to extract exceptions from the
  exception returned until you get the real root exception 
 returns
      a throwable containing the root login exception if a login exception did not occur null will be returned 
 
 i would like to know which api to call in websphere liberty in order to find the root cause of failure of login 
 why wssubjectgetrootloginexception is needed 
 the custom implementation of  comibmwebspheresecurityuserregistry  requires that you validate the username and password entered by the web application user by providing your own definition of  checkpasswordstring usersecurityname string passwd  please see  httpwwwibmcomsupportknowledgecenterenssaw57855comibmwebspherenddocaecseccustomauthhtml 
 if the user provides incorrect information you may throw  passwordcheckfailedexception  or  customregistryexception  with your message this  checkpasswordstring usersecurityname string passwd  is  actually invoked by the websphere traditional or liberty from jaas  javaxsecurityauthspiloginmodulelogin  and  passwordcheckfailedexception  or  customregistryexception  and their  messages are wrapped and  javaxsecurityauthloginloginexception  is thrown 
 in order to provide feedback to the web application user we need to get hold of the exception thrown from  javaxsecurityauthspiloginmodulelogin 
the way to do this is by calling  comibmwebspheresecurityauthwssubjectgetrootloginexception  from a servlet filter this works fine in websphere traditional but not any more  in websphere liberty the problem is that ibm has not documented this limitation anywhere

 now  having first experienced smalltalk back in 1981  i dont understand these questions very well  it seems rather natural that id want the editor and debugger to be savvy of my current code state and integrate with the change control system that is smalltalkaware using an external editor or debugger or change control manager would seem very awkward 
 so what is it that scares you the most about not being able to edit the fiveline methods in smalltalk with your favorite editor or use your favorite nonsmalltalkaware change control system

Spreadsheet-like control for a web application?,"a client of mine is looking to convert a critical application based on multiple very complex spreadsheets into a web app  as part of this theyd like some of the web pages they use to entermodel data to resemble a spreadsheet as much as possible 
 id be interested to know if anyone has any experiencerecommendations for embeddable controls that could do this better than standard htmljavascriptajax code  although suggestions for javascript frameworks that could do this are welcome too  im thinking mainly of activex flex java or similar controls commercial or open source are fine 
 the coding languages to be used and platform is still open to debate so aspnet against ie or phpflex against firefox or some other combination is fine  this will be driven by the business requirement not the platform   
 functionality is of course the main driving force but its always useful to have nice looking eye candy so skinable and cool is a plus  with reference to javascript frameworks ive previously used dojo and mootools but id prefer something with a bit more snap

How to access SOAP services from iPhone,"im planning to develop an app for the iphone and that app would have to access a couple of soap services while doing some basic checking in the iphone sdk i was not able to find any support for accessing soap services a bit of googling lead to the conclusion that there is no support for soap in the iphone sdk  
 so if i do want to build that app ill need to come up with a approach to access soap services from the iphone what would be the best approach any best practices did someone already write a library using the functionality that is present in the iphone sdk to access soap services 
 since the service i need to access is exposed by another party and they only expose it as soap its unfortunately not an option to switch to another type of interface eg rest based api

jQuery .ready in a dynamically inserted iframe,"we are using jquery  thickbox  to dynamically display an iframe when someone clicks on a picture  in this iframe we are using  galleria  a javascript library to display multiple pictures 
 the problem seems to be that  documentready  in the iframe seems to be fired too soon and the iframe content isnt even loaded yet so galleria code is not applied properly on the dom elements   documentready  seems to use the iframe parent ready state to decide if the iframe is ready 
 if we extract the function called by document ready in a separate function and call it after a timeout of 100 ms it works but we cant take the chance in production with a slow computer

TensorFlow: Does it only have SGD algorithms? or does it also have others like LBFGS,"question about tensorflow 
 i was looking at the video and model on the site and it appeared to only have sgd as an algorithm for machine learning i was wondering if other algorithms are also included in tensorflow such as lbfgs

data shuffling by sample() decreases RMSE to lower value in testingset than trainingset,"i have detected a peculiar effect that rmse gets lower for the testing set than that of the training set with the  sample  function with the  caret  package  
 my code does a common split of training and testing set 
   setseedseed
  trainingindex  createdatapartitiondatasettargetlabel p  08 list  false
  trainingset  datasettrainingindex 
  testingset  datasettrainingindex 
 
 this eg gives an rmse for testing set  0651  which is higher than training set rmse  0575   as expected 
 following the recommendation of many sources eg  here  the data should be shuffled so i do it  before the above split 
    shuffle data  short version
  setseed17
  dataset  data  nrow  sample  data
 
 after this shuffle the testing set rmse gets lower  0528  than the training set rmse  0575  this finding is consistent across a number of algorithms including  lm glm knn kknn rf gbm svmlinear svmradial  etc 
 according to my knowledge the default of sample is  replace  false  so there cant be any data leakage into the testing set the same observation occurs in classification for accuracy and kappa although the  createdatapartition  performs stratification so any data imbalance should be handled 
 i dont use any extraordinary configuration just ordinary crossvalidation 
   trainingconfiguration  traincontrol
    method  repeatedcv number  10
     repeats  cvrepeats
     savepredictions  final
      returnresamp  all
    
 
 what did i miss here 
  
 update 1 hunch about data leakage into testing set 
 i checked the data distribution and found a potential hint for the described effect 
 training set distribution 
    freq      prop
1 1  124 13581599
2 2  581 63636364
3 3  194 21248631
4 4   14  1533406
 
 testing set distribution  without  shuffle 
    freq      prop
1 1   42 18502203
2 2  134 59030837
3 3   45 19823789
4 4    6  2643172
 
 testing set distribution  with  shuffle 
    freq      prop
1 1   37 16299559
2 2  139 61233480
3 3   45 19823789
4 4    6  2643172
 
 if we look at the mode most frequent value its proportion in the testing set with shuffle  612  is closer to the training set proportion  636  than without shuffle  590   
 i dont know how to interpret this statistically by underlying theory  can anybody 
 an intuition of mine is that the shuffling makes the stratification of the testing set distribution implicitly performed by  createdatapartition  more stratified  by that i mean closer to the training set distribution this may cause the effect of data leakage into the opposite direction  into the testing set

"REST: how to serialize a java object to JSON in a ""shallow"" way?","suppose i have the following jpa entities

entity
public class outer

 both spring and java ee have rest implementations with default serializers which will marshall the entities tofrom json without further coding but when converting  outer  to json both spring and ee nest a full copy of  inner  within it

 this is correct behavior but problematic for my web services since the object graphs can get deepcomplex and can contain circular references is there any way to configure the supplied marshaller to marshall the pojosentities in a shallow way instead without having to create a custom json serializer for each one one custom serializer that works on all entities would be fine id ideally like something like this

 the best information ive found is on microsofts site regarding the requirements for 720p playback  httpwwwmicrosoftcomwindowswindowsmediacontentproviderfilmchoosingpcaspx 
 the difference here is that true high definition 720p 280x720 is between 510 mbps we are streaming half the resolution size and only 1 mbps

Broken tab navigation in popup with WPF user control hosted inside Winforms in default AppDomain,"i have a wpf user control that uses a popup this control is a plugin and can be loaded in the main appdomain or in a separate appdomain and it is hosted in a winforms form using elementhost when the plugin is loaded in the main appdomain and the popup is opened tabbing between the fields of the popup instead moves focus to the first control of the popup windows parent when it is loaded in a new appdomain the tab behavior works as expecteddesired it cycles through the controls in the popup window 
 i have read through many similar but not quite the same questions here on so and elsewhere but none of the suggestions have helped 
 it appears that the tab message is getting handled in the addinhost which comes from my use of frameworkelementadapters to marshal the wpf control across domain boundaries in outofdomain case my ultimate goal is to implement this as a managed addin framework addin but i have pared that way down to simplify the repro 
 in case it helps to have a more complete context i have  a git repo of the simplified repro 
 what can i do to make this behavior consistent

"Function pointers, Closures, and Lambda","i am just now learning about function pointers and as i was reading the kr chapter on the subject the first thing that hit me was hey this is kinda like a closure i knew this assumption is fundamentally wrong somehow and after a search online i didnt find really any analysis of this comparison 
 so why are cstyle function pointers fundamentally different from closures or lambdas as far as i can tell it has to do with the fact that the function pointer still points to a defined named function as opposed to the practice of anonymously defining the function 
 why is passing a function to a function seen as more powerful in the second case where it is unnamed than the first where it is just a normal everyday function that is being passed 
 please tell me how and why i am wrong to compare the two so closely

"Maximum recursion depth exceeded, but only when using a decorator","im writing a program to calculate levenshtein distance in python i implemented memoization because i am running the algorithm recursively my original function implemented the memoization in the function itself heres what it looks like 
  memoization table mapping from a tuple of two strings to their levenshtein distance
dp  

 levenshtein distance algorithm
def levs t

   if the strings are 0 return length of other
  if not s
    return lent
  if not t
    return lens

   if the last two characters are the same no cost otherwise cost of 1
  if s1 is t1
    cost  0
  else
    cost  1

   save in dictionary if never calculated before
  if not s1 t in dp
    dps1 t  levs1 t
  if not s t1 in dp
    dps t1  levs t1
  if not s1 t1 in dp
    dps1 t1  levs1 t1

   returns minimum chars to delete from s t and both
  return mindps1 t  1
             dps t1  1
             dps1 t1  cost
 
 this works however i found a way to memoize  using decorators  i tried to apply this technique to my algorithm 
  memoization table mapping from a tuple of two strings to their levenshtein distance
def memoizefunc
  memo  
  def wraps t
    if s t not in memo
      memos t  funcs t
    return memos t
  return wrap

 levenshtein distance algorithm
memoize  lev  memoizelev
def levs t

   if the strings are 0 return length of other
  if not s
    return lent
  if not t
    return lens

   if the last two characters are the same no cost otherwise cost of 1
  if s1 is t1
    cost  0
  else
    cost  1

   returns minimum chars to delete from s t and both
  return minlevs1 t  1
             levs t1  1
             levs1 t1  cost
 
 to me this looks cleaner and less confusing i thought that the two would be functionally equivalent but when i ran the version with the decorator i was surprised to find that i got a  recursionerror maximum recursion depth exceeded  
 what exactly am i missing is using the decorator not functionally equivalent i attempted a fix by adding  syssetrecursionlimit1500  and this works but it is a hack and doesnt explain why the two function differently  
 note i am using one paragraph of lorem ipsum as my test strings for s and t from wikipedia

Can't detect when Windows Font Size has changed C++ MFC,"im trying to determine how i can detect when the user changes the windows font size from normal to extra large fonts the font size is selected by executing the following steps on a windows xp machine 
 
 rightclick on the desktop and select properties 
 click on the appearance tab 
 select the font size normallarge fontsextra large fonts 
 
 my understanding is that the font size change results in a dpi change so here is what ive tried so far 
 
 my goal 
 i want to detect when the  windows font size  has changed from normal to large or extra large fonts and take some actions based on that font size change  i assume that when the windows font size changes the dpi will also change especially when the size is extra large fonts 
 
 what ive tried so far 
 i receive several messages including wmsettingchange wmnccalcsize wmncpaint etc but none of these messages are unique to the situation when the font size changes in other words when i receive the wmsettingschange message i want to know what changed 
 in theory when i define the onsettingchange and windows calls it the lpszsection should tell me what the changing section is and that works fine but then i check the given section by calling systemparametersinfo and i pass in the action spigetnonclientmetrics and i step through the debugger and i make sure that i watch the data in the returned nonclientmetrics for any font changes but none occur 
 even if that didnt work i should still be able to check the dpi when the settings change i really wouldnt care about the other details every time i get the wmsettingchange message i would just check the dpi and perform the actions im interested in performing but im not able to get the system dpi either 
 i have tried to get the dpi by invoking the method getsystemmetrics also for each dc 
 dekstop dcgetdevicecaps logpixelsxlogpixelsy
window dcgetdevicecaps logpixelsxlogpixelsy
current dcgetdevicecaps logpixelsxlogpixelsy 
 even if i change the dpi in the graphic properties window these values dont return anything different they always show 96

Fastest way to do a case-insensitive substring search in C/C++?,"note 
 the question below was asked in 2008 about some code from 2003 as the ops  update  shows this entire post has been obsoleted by vintage 2008 algorithms and persists here only as a historical curiosity 
 
 i need to do a fast caseinsensitive substring search in cc my requirements are as follows 
 
 should behave like strstr ie return a pointer to the match point 
 must be caseinsensitive doh 
 must support the current locale 
 must be available on windows msvc 80 or easily portable to windows ie from an open source library 
 
 here is the current implementation i am using taken from the gnu c library 
  return the offset of one string within another

  my personal strstr implementation that beats most other algorithms
  until someone tells me otherwise i assume that this is the
  fastest implementation of strstr in c
  i deliberately chose not to comment it  you should have at least
  as much fun trying to understand it as i had to write it

 can you make this code faster or do you know of a better implementation 
 note  i noticed that the gnu c library now has  a new implementation of  strstr  but i am not sure how easily it can be modified to be caseinsensitive or if it is in fact faster than the old one in my case i also noticed that  the old implementation is still used for wide character strings  so if anyone knows why please share 
 update 
 just to make things clear—in case it wasnt already—i didnt write this function its a part of the gnu c library i only modified it to be caseinsensitive 
 also thanks for the tip about  strcasestr  and checking out other implementations from other sources like openbsd freebsd etc it seems to be the way to go the code above is from 2003 which is why i posted it here in hope for a better version being available which apparently it is

 i do not have the source code of the application because it was programmed by an external company whos not releasing the code 
 ive noticed that the application performs well when i restart iis but after some testing after i have opened and closed my browser for a couple of hours the application starts to get slower and slower i was wondering if this behaviour was due to a bad closing connection practice from the programmers  im suspecting an open connection leak on the database here 
 i guess the net garbage collector will eventually close them but that can take a while no 
 ive got sql server management studio and i do notice from the activity monitor that there are quite a few connections opened on the database 
 from all thats being said above here are some questions related to the main question   
 
 is there any way to know in sql
server 2005 if connections are
open because theyre waiting to be
used in a connection pool or if
theyre open because they are used by an
application

Floating-point optimizations - guideline,"the majority of scientific computing problems that we need solve by implementing a particular algorithm in cc demands accuracy that are much lower than double precision for example  1e6   1e7  accuracy covers  99  of the cases for ode solvers or numerical integration even in the rare cases when we do need higher accuracy usually the numerical method itself fail before we can dream of reaching an accuracy that is near double precision example we cant expect 1e16 accuracy from a simple runge–kutta method even when solving a standard nostiff ordinary differential equation because of roundoff errors in this case the double precision requirement is analogous of as asking to have a better approximation of the wrong answer 
 then aggressive float point optimizations seems to be a winwin situation in most cases because it makes your code faster a lot faster and it does not affect the target accuracy of your particular problem that said it seems remarkable difficult to make sure that a particular implementationcode is stable against fp optimizations classical and somewhat disturbing example gsl the gnu scientific library is not only the standard numerical library in the market but also it is a very well written library i cant imagine myself doing a better job however gsl is not stable against fp optimizations in fact if you compile gsl with intel compiler for example then its internal tests will fail unless you turn on  fpmodel strict  flag which turn off fp optimizations  
 thus my question is are there general guidelines for writing code that is stable against aggressive floating point optimizations are these guidelines language compiler specific if so what are the cc gccicc best practices 
 note 1 this question is not asking what are the fp optimizations flags in gccicc 
 note 2 this question is not asking about general guidelines for cc optimization like dont use virtual functions for small functions that are called a lot 
 note 3 this question is not asking the list of most standard fp optimizations like xx  1  
 note 4 i strongly believe this is not a subjectiveofftopic question similar to the classical the coolest server names if you disagree because i am not providing a concrete examplecodeproblem please flag it as community wiki i am much more interested in the answer than gaining a few status points not they are not important  you get the point

Can a C compiler rearrange stack variables?,"i have worked on projects for embedded systems in the past where we have rearranged the order of declaration of stack variables to decrease the size of the resulting executable  for instance if we had 
 void func

    char c
    int i
    short s
    

 
 we would reorder this to be 
 void func

    int i
    short s
    char c
    

 
 because of alignment issues the first one resulted in 12 bytes of stack space being used and the second one resulted in only 8 bytes 
 is this standard behavior for c compilers or just a shortcoming of the compiler we were using   
 it seems to me that a compiler should be able to reorder stack variables to favor smaller executable size if it wanted to  it has been suggested to me that some aspect of the c standard prevents this but i havent been able to find a reputable source either way 
 as a bonus question does this also apply to c compilers 
 edit 
 if the answer is yes cc compilers can rearrange stack variables can you give an example of a compiler that definitely does this  id like to see compiler documentation or something similar that backs this up 
 edit again 
 thanks everybody for your help  for documentation the best thing ive been able to find is the paper  optimal stack slot assignment in gcc pdf by naveen sharma and sanjiv kumar gupta which was presented at the gcc summit proceedings in 2003 
 the project in question here was using the ads compiler for arm development  it is mentioned in the documentation for that compiler that ordering declarations like ive shown can improve performance as well as stack size because of how the armthumb architecture calculates addresses in the local stack frame  that compiler didnt automatically rearrange locals to take advantage of this  the paper linked here says that as of 2003 gcc also didnt rearrange the stack frame to improve locality of reference for armthumb processors but it implies that you could 
 i cant find anything that definitely says this was ever implemented in gcc but i think this paper counts as proof that youre all correct  thanks again

Preventing Users from Working on the Same Row,"i have a web application at work that is similar to a ticket working system some users enter new issues other workers choose and resolve issues all of the data is maintained in ms sql server 2005 
 the users working to resolve issues go to a page where they can view open issues because up to twenty people can be looking at this page at the same time one potential problem i had to address was what happens if someone picks an issue that someone else picked just after their page loaded 
 to address this i did two things first the gridview displaying the issues to select uses an ajax timer to update every second once an issue has been selected it disappears one second later at most in case they select one within this second they get a message asking them to choose another 
 the problem is that the ajax part of this is sending too many updates this is what i am assuming and it is affecting the performance of the page and database in addition the updates are not performing every second i find the timer to be unreliable when working to trigger stored procedures 
 there has to be a better way but i cant seem to find one does anyone have experience with a situation like this or have suggestions to keep multiple users from selecting the same record to maintain i really do not want to disable the ajax part entirely because i feel the message alone would make the application frustrating to use

Which language would you use for the self-study of SICP?,"ive caught the bug to learn functional programming for real so my
next selfstudy project is to work through the  structure and
interpretation of computer programs  unfortunately ive never
learned lisp as i was not a cs major in college  
 while sicp does not emphasize the tools for programming doing the
exercises entails picking a lisplike language to use it seems like
some implementation of  scheme  would be the path of least
resistance on the other hand i hear of others who have used  common
lisp  and  clojure  it seems to me that common lisp or clojure would be
more likely to be used in production code and therefore slightly
better for my resume btw i fully get the argument that learning a
language is worthwhile for its own sake but learning a language that
helps my resume is still a benefit im a capitalist and an academic
about my learning 
 if you had to selfstudy sicp which language would you pick and why
ideally i would like to use a language that can run on the jvm
i can certainly work with a language where repl works with bash
and emacs

Trouble getting the screenshot of any element after zooming in,"im trying to take a screenshot of a desired portion from a webpage using python in combination with selenium when i execute my script i do get a screenshot but that is not what i intended to let the script grab

 i then give this code to two people that live in different cities and they hit my api from their respective houses just from some browser what information can my api get out of the http request that will allow me to tell apart person a and person b calling it is the ip always available is the mac address ever available what else is there  
 how can person a pretend to be person b when calling my api  
 furthermore what if person c calls my web api from their own web api backend will the same information be available or what will be different  
 this is a general question but if you want to get specific lets assume aspnet web api 2 is receiving the http requests

Authorizing REST Requests,"im working on a rest service that has a few requirements 
 
 it has to be secure 
 users should not be able to forge requests 
 
 my current proposed solution is to have a custom authorization header that look like this this is the same way that the amazon web services work 
 authorization myapi usernamesignature
 
 my question is how to form the signature  when the user logs into the service they are given a secret key which they should be able to use to sign requests  this will stop other users submitting requests on their behalf but will not stop them forging requests 
 the application that will be using this service is an iphone application so i was thinking we could have a public key embedded in the application which we can do an additional signature with but does this mean well have to have two signatures one for the user key and one for the app key 
 any advice would be greatly appreciated id quite like to get this right the first time

 when i inspect my app with  instrument  allocations  and just scroll down my uitableview with 40 cells containing picture a bit like instagram i got a huge amount of memory used  see screenshot 
 
 but it seems to be  vm  and especially  vm cg raster data  from the coregraphics library 
 so the questions are  
 
 is it normal 
 is that a serious problem 
 is there a way to avoid this 
 
 im sorry but after few search on the web i cant find any relevant information concerning the  vm cg raster data  any idea thanks in advance

Why is request.getRemoteUser() returning the tomcat windows service account sometimes,"im trying to get windows authentification to work with a 3rd party application developped with gwt 
im hosting the app with tomcat on a windows server  i access the site through an iis proxy installed following the tomcats documentation  
 if i modify a jsp of the webapp to display  requestgetremoteuser   i get the username im hopping for my windows account  
 but the webapp authenticate me with the account i installed the tomcat windows service with on the server  
 in the decompiled source code of the webapp i see a call to the exact same requestgetremoteuser  so i wonder where can be the difference  
 here are the decompiled classes   
 import javaxservlethttphttpservletrequest

public class remoteuserloginprovider
  extends baserequestloginprovider

  public string extractloginfromrequesthttpservletrequest request
  
    return requestgetremoteuser

 could my problem be linked to this bug on googles guice   httpsgithubcomgoogleguiceissues780

Replace keys in an array based on another lookup/mapping array,"i have an associative array in the form  key  value  where key is a numerical value however it is not a sequential numerical value the key is actually an id number and the value is a count this is fine for most instances however i want a function that gets the humanreadable name of the array and uses that for the key without changing the value 
 i didnt see a function that does this but im assuming i need to provide the old key and new key both of which i have and transform the array is there an efficient way of doing this

Should an IBOutlet property be marked nullable or nonnull?,"in objectivec im used to declaring properties that connect to interface builder with 
 property nonatomic weak iboutlet uiview myview 
 
 now i have a class that uses the new xcode nullability attributes to preserve compatibility with swift what nullability attribute should an  iboutlet  have according to apples  using swift with cocoa and objectivec  
 
 when you declare an outlet in swift you should make the type of the outlet an implicitly unwrapped optional this way you can let the storyboard connect the outlets at runtime after initialization when your class is initialized from a storyboard or xib file you can assume that the outlet has been connected 
 
 so does this mean the outlet should be declared  nonnull  in objectivec
