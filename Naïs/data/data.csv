"How to perform low-level IO with a USB flash drive under the BIOS (compared to a floppy)?","<p>I have recently been studying some bootstrap code which was intended for use with a floppy drive. My goal is to modify the program so that it uses my USB flash drive. Now I see how the INT 13H function has been used with the floppy device, but I guess my question is, how will communicating with the USB drive differ?</p>

<p>For example, here is a snippet of the floppy code (GNU assembler):
<pre><code></p>

<pre><code>    movb    $0x00,%dl       /* select 1st floppy */

    /* later */

    movw    sec,%cx     /* get sector number */
    movw    head,%dx    /* get head number */

    movw    $0x0201,%ax /* read 1 sector */
    int $0x13
</code></pre>

<p></pre></code></p>

<p>Now I have read that moving 0x80 into %dl will select the first HDD in the BIOS. In my particular bios I can change the drive order, which would include a USB drive. I am quite sure this is becoming BIOS dependant, but I was thinking that the order listed in the BIOS could correspond to the value I move into %dl. I need to track down some documentation...</p>

<p>I am really unfamiliar with working with block devices as it is, can someone point me to a good place to start learning more?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

"Ionic 2 / Ionic 3 / Ionic 4 : (Lazy) Loading spinner for pictures","<p>I'm using ion-img in my ionic2 application to load my pictures correctly. However, I wonder if there is a way to indicate to the user that the picture is actually loading.</p>

<p>Thank you for your help!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT : Here is the answer if you absolutely need to use the ion-img tag. If not, you should use <a href=""https://www.npmjs.com/package/ionic-image-loader"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ionic-image-loader</a> as <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/7762525/admindev826"">AdminDev826</a> suggested.</strong></p>

<p>I finally solved that problem with CSS! When an image is loading in ionic 2, the ion-img tag doesn't have any class. However, when the image is finally loaded, the ion-img tag get the class ""img-loaded"".</p>

<p>Here is my solution :</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;ion-img [src]=""img.src""&gt;&lt;/ion-img&gt;
  &lt;ion-spinner&gt;&lt;/ion-spinner&gt;

<p>And my CSS :</p>

<pre><code>.img-loaded + ion-spinner {

"FFMPEG: ‘PIX_FMT_BGR24’ was not declared in this scope","<p>I am building a simple decoding application using FFMPEG API.

".NET Entity framework project layout (architecture)","<p>I'm trying to determine how best to architect a .NET Entity Framework project to achieve a nice layered approach. So far I've tried it out in a browse-based game where the players own and operate planets. Here's how I've got it:</p>

<p><strong>Web Site</strong></p>

<p>This contains all the front end.</p>

<p><strong>C# Project - MLS.Game.Data</strong> </p>

<p>This contains the EDMX file with all my data mappings. Not much else here.</p>

<p><strong>C# Project - MLS.Game.Business</strong> </p>

<p>This contains various classes that I call 'Managers' such as PlanetManager.cs.  The planet manager has various static methods that are used to interact with the planet, such as <em>getPlanet(int planetID)</em> which would return an generated code object from MLS.Game.Data.</p>

<p>From the website, I'll do something like this:</p>

<p><code>var planet = PlanetManager.getPlanet(1);</code></p>

<p>It returns a <em>Planet</em> object from from the MLS.Game.Data (generated from the EDMX). It works, but it bothers me to a degree because it means that my front end has to reference MLS.Game.Data. I've always felt that the GUI should only need to reference the Business project though.  </p>

<p>In addition, I've found that my Manager classes tend to get very heavy. I'll end up with dozens of static methods in them.</p>

<p>So... my question is - how does everyone else lay out their ASP EF projects?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>After some more though, there's additional items which bother me. For example, let's say I have my Planet object, which again is generated code from the wizard. What if a time came that my Planet needed to have a specialized property, say ""Population"" which is a calculation of some sort based on other properties of the Planet object. Would I want to create a new class that inherits from Planet and then return that instead? (hmm, I wonder if those classes are sealed by the EF?)</p>

"cv::imshow sometimes is very slow","<p>I've got a problem with <code>cv::imshow</code>. It normally consumes about 1-2 ms processing time for my image size but at some point in my processing-pipeline it uses 4-8 ms for the same kind of images.</p>

<p>I have a method </p>

<pre><code>void Tool::displayImage()
{
   startTimeMeasure();
   cv::imshow(""output"",image);
   evaluateTimeMeasure();
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>image</code> is a member variable and the highgui window is created somewhere else. 
Time measurement works with <code>boost::posix_time ptime</code> and <code>time_duration</code>.</p>

<pre><code>cvStartWindowThread();
</code></pre>

<p>was called.</p>

<p>The point is, that if <code>displayImage()</code> is called within a complex processing chain (loading image from videofile, some preprocessing etc), <code>cv::imshow</code> becomes very slow, while a call in a ""paused"" video to redraw an updated image is very fast.</p>

<p>If I add a <code>cv::waitKey(10)</code> before the time measurement's beginning, <code>cv::imshow</code> becomes fast, too. So there might be some (gui?) things which have to be processed which block <code>cv::imshow</code>? <code>cv::waitKey(40)</code> is called in a separate thread in loop which waits for keyboard input to control (e.g. pause/resume) the video.
As far as I know, <code>cv::imshow</code> is performed in some kind of queue which is processed during <code>cv::waitKey</code> times?!? Where can I find information about all the tasks which are performed during that times?

<p>I'm trying to set up an App with a <code>UITabViewController</code>, and one of the Tabs will have a UITableView and UISearchBar (but no Navigation Controller).  I set up the <code>UITabViewController</code> with all the tabs in interface builder, and the views are in their own xib files.

"Need Better Algorithm for Finding Mapping Between 2 Sets of Points with Minimum Distance","<p><strong>Problem:</strong> I have two overlapping 2D shapes, A and B, each shape having the same number of pixels, but differing in shape. Some portion of the shapes are overlapping, and there are some pieces of each that are not overlapping. My goal is to move all the non-overlapping pixels in shape A to the non-overlapping pixels in shape B. Since the number of pixels in each shape is the same, I should be able to find a 1-to-1 mapping of pixels. The restriction is that I want to find the mapping that minimizes the total distance traveled by all the pixels that moved.</p>

<p><strong>Brute Force:</strong> The brute force approach to solving this problem is obviously out of the question, since I would have to compute the total distance of all possible mappings of which I think there are n! (where n is the number of non-overlapping pixels in one shape) times the computation of calculating a distance for each pair of points in the mapping, n, giving a total of O( n * n! ) or something similar.</p>

<p><strong>Backtracking:</strong> The only ""better"" solution I could think of was to use backtracking, where I would keep track of the current minimum so far and at any point when I'm evaluating a certain mapping, if I reach or exceed that minimum, I move on to the next mapping. Even this won't do any better than O( n! ).</p>

<p>Is there any way to solve this problem with a reasonable complexity?</p>

<p>Also note that the ""obvious"" approach of simply mapping a point to it's closest matching neighbour does not always yield the optimum solution.</p>

<p><strong>Simpler Approach?:</strong> As a secondary question, if a feasible solution doesn't exist, one possibility might be to partition each non-overlapping section into small regions, and map these regions, greatly reducing the number of mappings. To calculate the distance between two regions I would use the center of mass (average of the pixel locations in the region). However, this presents the problem of how I should go about doing the partitioning in order to get a near-optimal answer.</p>

"Convert float to string in positional format (without scientific notation and false precision)","<p>I want to print some floating point numbers so that they're always written in decimal form (e.g. <code>12345000000000000000000.0</code> or <code>0.000000000000012345</code>, not in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation"" rel=""noreferrer"">scientific notation</a>, yet I'd want to the result to have the up to ~15.7 <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_figures"" rel=""noreferrer"">significant figures</a> of a IEEE 754 double, and no more. </p>

<p>What I want is <strong><em>ideally</em> so that the result is the <em>shortest</em> string in positional decimal format that still results in the same value when converted to a <code>float</code></strong>.</p>

<p>It is well-known that the <code>repr</code> of a <code>float</code> is written in scientific notation if the exponent is greater than 15, or less than -4:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; n = 0.000000054321654321
&gt;&gt;&gt; n
5.4321654321e-08  # scientific notation
</code></pre>

<p>If <code>str</code> is used, the resulting string again is in scientific notation:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; str(n)
'5.4321654321e-08'
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>It has been suggested that I can use <code>format</code> with <code>f</code> flag and sufficient precision to get rid of the scientific notation:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; format(0.00000005, '.20f')
'0.00000005000000000000'
</code></pre>

<p>It works for that number, though it has some extra trailing zeroes. But then the same format fails for <code>.1</code>, which gives decimal digits beyond the actual machine precision of float:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; format(0.1, '.20f')
'0.10000000000000000555'
</code></pre>

<p>And if my number is <code>4.5678e-20</code>, using <code>.20f</code> would still lose relative precision:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; format(4.5678e-20, '.20f')
'0.00000000000000000005'
</code></pre>

<p>Thus <strong>these approaches do not match my requirements</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p>This leads to the question: what is the easiest and also well-performing way to print arbitrary floating point number in decimal format, having the same digits as in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/28493269/918959""><code>repr(n)</code> (or <code>str(n)</code> on Python 3)</a>, but always using the decimal format, not the scientific notation.</p>

<p>That is, a function or operation that for example converts the float value <code>0.00000005</code> to string <code>'0.00000005'</code>; <code>0.1</code> to <code>'0.1'</code>; <code>420000000000000000.0</code> to <code>'420000000000000000.0'</code> or <code>420000000000000000</code> and formats the float value <code>-4.5678e-5</code> as <code>'-0.000045678'</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>After the bounty period: It seems that there are at least 2 viable approaches, as Karin demonstrated that using string manipulation one can achieve significant speed boost compared to my initial algorithm on Python 2.</p>

<p>Thus,</p>

<ul>
<li>If performance is important and Python 2 compatibility is required; or if the <code>decimal</code> module cannot be used for some reason, then <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/38983595/918959"">Karin's approach using string manipulation</a> is the way to do it.</li>
<li>On Python 3, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/38847691/918959"">my somewhat shorter code will also be faster</a>.</li>

<p>I guess one could put in a dummy parameter at the very end, keep moving the first argument to the end or expanding it to the front if its a List and specialize on the first parameter being my dummy to stop recursion. That seems like a lot of work for the compiler just to flatten a list though.</p>

<pre><code>namespace Detail{
    struct MyMagicType {};
    template&lt;typename T, typename... Ts&gt;
    struct FlattenTree{
        typedef typename FlattenTree&lt;Ts..., T&gt;::Type Type;
    };
    template&lt;typename... Ts&gt;
    struct FlattenTree&lt;MyMagicType,Ts...&gt;{      //termination case
        typedef List&lt;Ts...&gt; Type;
    };
    template&lt;typename... Ts, typename... Us&gt;
    struct FlattenTree&lt;List&lt;Ts...&gt;, Us...&gt;{
        typedef typename FlattenTree&lt;Ts..., Us...&gt;::Type Type;
    };              //expand Ts to front because they may hold more nested Lists
}

template&lt;typename... Ts&gt;
struct FlattenTree{
    typedef typename Detail::FlattenTree&lt;Ts...,Detail::MyMagicType&gt;::Type Type;
};
</code></pre>

<p>This works on MSVC2013 but I don't think its the best way possible since I needed a dummy type and it puts a lot of load on the compiler. I want to use it with lists containing 500+ elements.</p>

"Web app deployment Best Practices : how to manage local & live files?","<p>I am writing php web applications, and simply deploy them via FTP.
To make it work, I often have some tweaking/debugging to do given that I have little control over the (free) web server hosting me, so what's working in my local environment might not work live.</p>

<p>For example I keep a separate php file containing class_db_myapp.php which extends a class_db.php with specific DB parameters : db name, username, password which won't be the same local and live.
(For information : Lately I started using git for version control)</p>

<p>As my app evolves, some files get renamed / deleted / created.
When comes the time to upload a new version, I have to either rely on my memory to know what I have to upload / delete or simply delete all / upload all. But in the second case I need to avoid erasing the class_db_myapp.php file...</p>

<p>I haven't come up with a proper solution to this.</p>

<p>What are the best practices in this domain?</p>

"Why isn't pass struct by reference a common optimization?","<p>Up until today, I had always thought that decent compilers automatically convert struct pass-by-value to pass-by-reference if the struct is large enough that the latter would be faster.  To the best of my knowledge, this seems like a no-brainer optimization.  However, to satisfy my curiosity as to whether this actually happens, I created a simple test case in both C++ and <a href=""http://www.digitalmars.com/d/1.0"" rel=""noreferrer"">D</a> and looked at the output of both GCC and Digital Mars D.  Both insisted on passing 32-byte structs by value when all the function in question did was add up the members and return the values, with no modification of the struct passed in.  The C++ version is below.</p>

<pre><code>#include ""iostream.h""

struct S {
    int i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p;
};

int foo(S s) {
    return s.i + s.j + s.k + s.l + s.m + s.n + s.o + s.p;
}

int main() {
    S s;
    int bar = foo(s);
    cout &lt;&lt; bar;
}
</code></pre>

<p>My question is, why the heck wouldn't something like this be optimized by the compiler to pass-by-reference instead of actually pushing all those <code>int</code>s onto the stack?</p>

<p>Note:  Compiler switches used:  GCC -O2 (-O3 inlined foo().), DMD -O -inline -release.</p>

<p>Edit:  Obviously, in the general case the semantics of pass-by-value vs. pass-by-reference won't be the same, such as if copy constructors are involved or the original struct is modified in the callee.  However, in a lot of real-world scenarios, the semantics will be identical in terms of observable behavior.  These are the cases I'm asking about.</p>

"C#, Linq2SQL: Creating a predicate to find elements within a number of ranges","<p>Lets say I have something called Stuff in my database, with a property called Id. From the user I get a sequence of selected Range objects (or rather I create them from their input) with the Ids they want. A stripped down version of that struct looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public struct Range&lt;T&gt; : IEquatable&lt;Range&lt;T&gt;&gt;, IEqualityComparer&lt;Range&lt;T&gt;&gt;
{
    public T A;
    public T B;
    public Range(T a, T b)
    {
        A = a;
        B = b;
    }
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>So one could for example have gotten:</p>

<pre><code>var selectedRange = new List&lt;Range&lt;int&gt;&gt;
    {
        new Range(1, 4),
        new Range(7,11),
    };
</code></pre>

<p>I then want to use that to create a predicate to select only things which have a value between those. For example, using the <a href=""http://www.albahari.com/nutshell/predicatebuilder.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">PredicateBuilder</a>, I can for example do that this way:</p>

<pre><code>var predicate = PredicateBuilder.False&lt;Stuff&gt;();
foreach (Range&lt;int&gt; r in selectedRange)
{
    int a = r.A;
    int b = r.B;
    predicate = predicate.Or(ø =&gt; ø.Id &gt;= a &amp;&amp; ø.Id &lt;= b);
}
</code></pre>

<p>and then:</p>

<pre><code>var stuff = datacontext.Stuffs.Where(predicate).ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>Which works! What I would like to do now, is to create a generic extension method to create those predicates for me. Kind of like this:</p>

<pre><code>public static Expression&lt;Func&lt;T,bool&gt;&gt; ToPredicate&lt;T&gt;(this IEnumerable&lt;Range&lt;int&gt;&gt; range, Func&lt;T, int&gt; selector)
{
    Expression&lt;Func&lt;T, bool&gt;&gt; p = PredicateBuilder.False&lt;T&gt;();
    foreach (Range&lt;int&gt; r in range)
    {
        int a = r.A;
        int b = r.B;
        p = p.Or(ø =&gt; selector(ø) &gt;= a &amp;&amp; selector(ø) &lt;= b);
    }
    return p;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Problem here, is that it crashes with a NotSupportedException because of the selector(ø) call: <code>Method 'System.Object DynamicInvoke(System.Object[])' has no supported translation to SQL.</code></p>

<p>I guess that is understandable. But is there any way to get around this? What I would like to end up with is so that I could just do:</p>

<pre><code>var stuff = datacontext.Stuffs.Where(selectedRange.ToPredicate&lt;Stuff&gt;(ø =&gt; ø.Id));
</code></pre>

<p>Or even better, create something that returns an IQueryable so that I could just do:</p>

<pre><code>var stuff = datacontext.Stuffs.WhereWithin&lt;Stuff&gt;(selectedRange, ø =&gt; ø.Id); // Possibly without having to specify Stuff as type there...
</code></pre>

<p>So, any ideas? I would really like to get this working, cause if not I will get A LOT of those foreach blocks of code, creating predicates...</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Note 1:</strong> Of course, would be nice if I could expand to more than int, like DateTime and such, but not sure how that ends up with using the >= and &lt;= operators...

<p><strong>Note 2:</strong> It is going to be used for reporting, where the user is going to be able to narrow down what comes out, based on different things. Like, I want this report for those people and those dates.</p>

"Syntax-highlighting textbox for Winforms, ASP.NET, WPF","<p>I'm looking for a syntax-highlighting Textbox component, preferably free, with source, and capable of being used in Winforms, ASP.NET and WPF alike. Also, it should support not just display, but also editing contents.</p>

"iOS 7 UIButtonBarItem image does not tint","<p>On my nav bar, I have a couple of rightBarButtonItems that have custom icons (the icon images are white, which worked well with the basic color scheme of iOS 6).</p>

<p>Under iOS 7, loading the images using initWithTitle (see code snippet 1) replaces the ""white"" color in the icon with the proper global tint (a specific color of dark blue in this case)</p>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 1</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>UIBarButtonItem *refreshButton = [[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithTitle:@"""" style:(UIBarButtonItemStyle) UIBarButtonSystemItemCancel target:(self) action:@selector(refreshList)];

refreshButton.image = [UIImage imageNamed:@""RefreshIcon.png""];
</code></pre>

<p>However, I needed to use initWithCustomView to overcome a weird change in behavior that was causing the icons to move out of view.  The basic idea was to specifically set the size of the icons.  initWithCustomView solved the sizing problem, but does not display the button images with the global tint, they are displayed in the color of the image (white).  Code Snippet 2 shows how I am creating the button with initWithCustomView.  </p>

<p><strong>Code Snippet 2</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>CGRect frameCustomButton2 = CGRectMake(0.0, 0.0, 18.0, 18.0);
UIButton *customButton2 = [[UIButton alloc] initWithFrame:frameCustomButton2];
[customButton2 setBackgroundImage:iconRefreshButton forState:UIControlStateNormal];
UIBarButtonItem *barCustomButton2 =[[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithCustomView:customButton2 ];
barCustomButton2.image = iconRefreshButton;
[customButton2 addTarget:self action:@selector(refreshList) forControlEvents:UIControlEventTouchUpInside];
</code></pre>

<p>All of this code is of course in (void)viewDidLoad.   I have tried things like:</p>

<pre><code>barCustomButton2.tintColor = [UIColor blackColor];  //doesn't work
</code></pre>

<p>or 
    [barButtonAppearance setTintColor:[UIColor blackColor]]; // doesn't work</p>

<p>and they do not override the white color of the image.  It is almost as if the creation of the custom view takes place after the view looks at the global tint color?</p>

<p>How can I ensure the button icon takes on the global tint? </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

"Best way to integrate StyleCop with TFS CI","<p>I've been doing research on how to enable source analysis for the project I'm working on and plan to use StyleCop. The setup I have is a TFS Server for source control, using TFS Continuous Integration. I want to enable source analysis for CI builds and daily builds run on the build machine, and not only for those run on developers' machines.</p>

<p>Here's an article from the documentation of StyleCop that I read on the subject:

"How do I get a thread ID from an arbitrary pthread_t?","<p>I have a pthread_t, and I'd like to change its CPU affinity. The problem is that I'm using glibc 2.3.2, which doesn't have <a href=""http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man3/pthread_setaffinity_np.3.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">pthread_setaffinity_np()</a>. That's OK, though, because pthread_setaffinity_np() is itself a wrapper of <a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/2/sched_setaffinity"" rel=""noreferrer"">sched_setaffinity()</a>, which can be called by passing a thread ID instead of a process ID to set the affinity for an arbitrary thread.</p>

<p><strong>BUT</strong> ... The thread id that sched_setaffinity can work with is an OS thread id, the kind that you can get from the <a href=""http://linux.die.net/man/2/gettid"" rel=""noreferrer"">gettid()</a> system call. <strong>This is different from the opaque type pthread_t</strong>, and gettid() will only return the thread-id of the <em>current thread</em>. I need to be able to set the CPU affinity of an arbitrary thread.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I can't access the pthread's private parts, which would let me steal the thread id by casting a pthread_t to a <code>struct pthread *</code>. All the better, I guess, since relying on private implementations is asking for even <em>more</em> trouble.</p>

<p>I've also been reading up on the <a href=""http://cs.pub.ro/~apc/2003/resources/pthreads/uguide/users-23.htm"" rel=""noreferrer"">pthread_getunique_np</a> function, however this returns a ""unique integral identifier"" -- which I don't believe is in any way shape or form equivalent to an OS thread id.</p>

"How do I go from Pandas DataFrame to Tensorflow BatchDataset for NLP?","<p>I'm honestly trying to figure out how to convert a dataset (format: pandas <code>DataFrame</code> or numpy array) to a form that a simple text-classification tensorflow model can train on for sentiment analysis. The dataset I'm using is similar to IMDB (containing both text and labels (positive or negative)). Every tutorial I've looked at has either prepared data differently, or didn't bother with data preparation and left it to your imagination. (For instance, all the IMDB tutorials import a preprocessed Tensorflow <code>BatchDataset</code> from <code>tensorflow_datasets</code>, which isn't helpful when I'm using my own set of data). My own attempts to convert a Pandas <code>DataFrame</code> to Tensorflow's <code>Dataset</code> types have resulted in ValueErrors or a negative loss during training. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>I had originally prepared my data as follows, where <code>training</code> and <code>validation</code> are already shuffled Pandas <code>DataFrame</code>s containing <code>text</code> and <code>label</code> columns:</p>

<pre><code># IMPORT STUFF

from __future__ import absolute_import, division, print_function, unicode_literals
import tensorflow as tf # (I'm using tensorflow 2.0)
from tensorflow import keras
from tensorflow.keras import layers
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
# ... [code for importing and preparing the pandas dataframe omitted]

# TOKENIZE

train_text = training['text'].to_numpy()
tok = Tokenizer(oov_token='&lt;unk&gt;')
tok.fit_on_texts(train_text)
tok.word_index['&lt;pad&gt;'] = 0
tok.index_word[0] = '&lt;pad&gt;'

train_seqs = tok.texts_to_sequences(train_text)
train_seqs = tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(train_seqs, padding='post')

train_labels = training['label'].to_numpy().flatten()

valid_text = validation['text'].to_numpy()
valid_seqs = tok.texts_to_sequences(valid_text)
valid_seqs = tf.keras.preprocessing.sequence.pad_sequences(valid_seqs, padding='post')

valid_labels = validation['label'].to_numpy().flatten()

# CONVERT TO TF DATASETS

train_ds = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((train_seqs,train_labels))
valid_ds = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((valid_seqs,valid_labels))

train_ds = train_ds.shuffle(BUFFER_SIZE).batch(BATCH_SIZE)
valid_ds = valid_ds.batch(BATCH_SIZE)

# PREFETCH

train_ds = train_ds.prefetch(buffer_size=tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE)
valid_ds = valid_ds.prefetch(buffer_size=tf.data.experimental.AUTOTUNE)
</code></pre>

<p>This resulted train_ds and valid_ds being tokenized and of type <code>PrefetchDataset</code> or <code>&lt;PrefetchDataset shapes: ((None, None, None, 118), (None, None, None)), types: (tf.int32, tf.int64)&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>I then trained as follows, but got a <em>large negative loss and an accuracy of 0</em>.</p>

<pre><code>model = keras.Sequential([
    layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim),
    layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D(),
    layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') # also tried activation='softmax'
])

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy', # binary_crossentropy
              metrics=['accuracy'])

history = model.fit(
    train_ds,
    epochs=1,
    validation_data=valid_ds, validation_steps=1, steps_per_epoch=BUFFER_SIZE)
</code></pre>

<p>If I don't do the fancy prefetch stuff, <code>train_ds</code> would be of type <code>BatchDataset</code> or <code>&lt;BatchDataset shapes: ((None, 118), (None,)), types: (tf.int32, tf.int64)&gt;</code>, but that also is getting me a negative loss and an accuracy of 0.</p>

<p>And if I just do the following: </p>

<pre><code>x, y = training['text'].to_numpy(), training['label'].to_numpy()
x, y = tf.convert_to_tensor(x),tf.convert_to_tensor(y)
</code></pre>

<p>then <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are of type <code>EagerTensor</code>, but I can't seem to figure out how to Batch an <code>EagerTensor</code>.</p>

<p><strong>What types and shapes do I really need for <code>train_ds</code>? What am I missing or doing wrong?</strong> </p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/text_classification_with_hub"" rel=""noreferrer"">text_classification_with_hub tutorial</a> trains an already prepared imdb dataset as shown:</p>

<pre><code>model = tf.keras.Sequential()
model.add(hub_layer)
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu'))
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='binary_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

history = model.fit(train_data.shuffle(10000).batch(512),
                    epochs=20,
                    validation_data=validation_data.batch(512),
                    verbose=1)
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, <code>train_data</code> is of form <code>tensorflow.python.data.ops.dataset_ops._OptionsDataset</code>, and <code>train_data.shuffle(1000).batch(512)</code> is <code>tensorflow.python.data.ops.dataset_ops.BatchDataset</code> (or <code>&lt;BatchDataset shapes: ((None,), (None,)), types: (tf.string, tf.int64)&gt;</code>). </p>

<p>They apparently didn't bother with tokenization with this dataset, but I doubt tokenization is my issue. Why does their <code>train_data.shuffle(10000).batch(512)</code> work but my <code>train_ds</code> not work? </p>

<p>It's possible the issue is with the model setup, the <code>Embedding</code> layer, or with tokenization, but I'm not so sure that's the case. I've already looked at the following tutorials for inspiration:</p>

<p>My HTML data content contains thousands of these local resource file so I can't unzip all of them before display content. With UIWebView, we are using NSURLProtocol subclass to intercept the request, detect local resource files and un-zip it on demand based on the html page which user is viewing. </p>

<p>I am having this issue when convert UIWebView to WKWebView.

<p><strong>2. Convert file scheme to the custom scheme (x-file) then load it with WKWebView</strong></p>

<pre><code>    let htmlPath = Bundle.main.path(forResource: ""index"", ofType: ""html"")
    var htmlURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: htmlPath!, isDirectory: false)                    
    htmlURL = self.changeURLScheme(newScheme: ""x-file"", forURL: htmlURL)
    self.webView.load(URLRequest(url: htmlURL))
</code></pre>

<p><br/>
<strong>3. Implement 2 methods of WKURLSchemeHandler protocol and handle 3 delegate methods of WKURLSchemeTask.</strong></p>

        // Your local resource files will be catch here. You can determine it by checking the urlSchemeTask.request.url.
        // From here I will unzip local resource files (js, css, png,...) if they are still in zip format
        ....

        // Handle WKURLSchemeTask delegate methods
        let url = changeURLScheme(newScheme: ""file"", forURL: urlSchemeTask.request.url!)

<li>my node version is 10.16.3</li>

<p>However, one thing that I can't figure out is how to output values of a variable just like  <code>System.println()</code> <strong>in Java</strong> or <code>console.log</code> <strong>in JavaScript</strong></p>

<h1>What I've tried so far</h1>

<p>Now, I'm very new to TypeScript but so far I've tried using console.log() command in one of the TypeScript files and it just doesn't allow me to use it:</p>

<p>Everytime I try to do this:</p>

<p><code>console.log(name); //name is a string</code></p>

"How to get service reference to generate correctly with message contracts based on 3rd party WSDL, or force no message contracts in WF Service project","<p>I have a problem that given 3rd party WSDL I am able from a Console App to easily create a service proxy that works, but from a WF4 WF service I am not. The generated proxy in the latter case is clearly buggy, involving specifically 2 problems:
a) Message contracts always generated when not requested or needed
b) Incorrect response messages and xml wrapper names used, resulting in null response objects and failed deserialization</p>

<p>The problem I am facing is in the actual generation of the Reference.cs class on the basis of 3rd party WSDL. In the WSDL there are many operations, and in order of appearance 2 of them are as so:</p>

<pre class=""lang-xml prettyprint-override""><code> &lt;operation name=""pu013""&gt;
      &lt;documentation&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;Check-response service&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;help&gt;The service handles (cut out)&lt;/help&gt;
      &lt;/documentation&gt;
      &lt;input message=""tns:pu013Request"" /&gt;
      &lt;output message=""tns:SimpleResponse"" /&gt;
 &lt;/operation&gt;

...
 &lt;operation name=""mi102""&gt;
      &lt;documentation&gt;
        &lt;description&gt;Instruction insert to Matching System&lt;/description&gt;
        &lt;help&gt;This service (cut out)&lt;/help&gt;
      &lt;/documentation&gt;
      &lt;input message=""tns:mi102Request"" /&gt;
      &lt;output message=""tns:SimpleResponse"" /&gt;
    &lt;/operation&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>What this results in in the Reference.cs is the following C#:</p>

<pre><code>WorkflowService1.PSE.pu013Response pu013(WorkflowService1.PSE.pu013Request request);

...

WorkflowService1.PSE.pu013Response mi102(WorkflowService1.PSE.mi102Request request); 
</code></pre>

<p>Note that for some reason the mi102 operation is generated with the INCORRECT response message of pu013Response, which is declared as this:</p>

<pre><code> [System.Diagnostics.DebuggerStepThroughAttribute()]
    [System.CodeDom.Compiler.GeneratedCodeAttribute(""System.ServiceModel"", ""4.0.0.0"")]
    [System.ServiceModel.MessageContractAttribute(WrapperName=""pu013Response"", WrapperNamespace=""http://pse/"", IsWrapped=true)]
    public partial class pu013Response { 
</code></pre>

<p>Note the WrapperName prevents the XML serializer from recognising the response, which is mi102Response, so for all operations that are not pu013 I always get a NULL response.</p>

<p>Also, this does NOT occur if I add a reference from a console application. This does not generate Message contracts, and in this case, invocation and response work.</p>

<p>What is different? Is svcutil being invoke behind the scenes? If so, what is different about the parameters used? Can svcutil be used to generate the xamlx activities too, so that I might find a command line workaround?</p>

<p>This looks like a VS / Add Service Reference bug. The alternative is to manually correct many operations in the Reference.cs.</p>

<p>Ideally, I am looking for a way to easily, automatically, run svcutil or Add Service Reference so that the Reference class is correct and the xamlx activities generated. A nice to have is an explanation of why there is a difference, and behind the scenes what is happening.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>:
Message contracts generated in the console app result in the same problem - incorrect Response declarations. The problem goes away if parameters are used instead of messages, which are not available from a WF service app.</p>

"Breeze compatible JavaScript GUI frameworks","<p><strong>While I already posted a similar question</strong> (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19504911/breeze-compatible-spa-building"">Breeze compatible SPA building</a>) and likely started something good going between IdeaBlade and Telerik as a consequence, I believe that Breeze deserves a lot wider recognition because of its unique approach to access Entity Framework on the server side. So, it seems pretty obvious to me that even notoriously complete JS frameworks like <strong>Sencha</strong> or <strong>Wakanda</strong> <em>need to ensure to work with Breeze</em>.</p>

<p>The current issues between KendoUI and Breeze are very clearly described in the post by Remco Blok at <a href=""http://www.kendoui.com/blogs/teamblog/posts/13-02-21/breeze_js_and_the_kendo_ui_datasource.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.kendoui.com/blogs/teamblog/posts/13-02-21/breeze_js_and_the_kendo_ui_datasource.aspx</a>. Stated succinctly the integration with Breeze should be made at the level of entities - not JSON data, which is the way almost everyone handles the transactions between a JS client and SQL server. </p>

<p>Wakanda is a great example of a very rich development environment with elaborate GUI Builder, Debugger etc that unfortunately cannot be used with ""legacy data"" on the server side.</p>

<p>As far as I know, Breeze works just fine with Angular, but Angular needs AngularUI (<a href=""http://angular-ui.github.io/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://angular-ui.github.io/</a>) which in turn is not as complete as I would like it to be and has some JQuery dependencies that may cause collisions. Pretty soon, Breeze will work with KendoUI (AFAIK) - does anyone know about some other collection of JavaScript frameworks that all together would offer the level of ease that Visual Studio provides for Windows desktop applications creation? (after all, JavaScript applications are desktop application with the distribution problem solved in a very elegant fashion).</p>

    host.AddServiceEndpoint(typeof(Inventory.InventoryService), new NetTcpBinding(),
        ""net.tcp://localhost:9000/GetInventory"");
    host.Open();
</code></pre>

<p>Everything compiles fine, and when the host goes to add the service endpoint, it bombs with this: ""The contract type Inventory.InventoryService is not attributed with ServiceContractAttribute.  In order to define a valid contract, the specified type (either contract interface or service class) must be attributed with ServiceContractAttribute.""</p>

<p>I know I'm missing something simple here.  I have the interface clearly marked as a service contract and there's a reference to that project in the Host project.</p>

"Overriding a property with an attribute","<p>I'm trying to find a way to change the serialization behavior of a property.</p>

<p>Lets say I have a situation like this:</p>

<pre><code>[Serializable]
public class Record
{
   public DateTime LastUpdated {get; set; }

   // other useful properties ...
}

public class EmployeeRecord : Record
{
   public string EmployeeName {get; set; }

   // other useful properties ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now I want to serialize EmployeeRecord. I don't want the LastUpdated property from the Record class to be serialized. (I do want LastUpdated to be serialized when I serialize Record, though).</p>

<p>First I tried hiding the LastUpdated property by using the <em>new</em> keyword and then adding the XmlIgnore attribute:</p>

<pre><code>public class EmployeeRecord : Record
{
   public string EmployeeName {get; set; }

   [XmlIgnore]
   public new DateTime LastUpdated {get; set; }
   // other useful properties ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>But that didn't work.  Then I tried making the base LastUpdated virtual and overriding it, keeping the attribute:</p>

<pre><code>[Serializable]
public class Record
{
   public virtual DateTime LastUpdated {get; set; }

   // other useful properties ...
}

public class EmployeeRecord : Record
{
   public string EmployeeName {get; set; }

   [XmlIgnore]
   public override DateTime LastUpdated {get; set; }
   // other useful properties ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>This didn't work either. In both attempts the LastUpdated ignored the XmlIgnore attribute and happily went about its business of serializing.</p>

<p>Is there a way to make what I'm trying to do happen?</p>

"Numerical range iterators in boost?","<p>I'm aware of the range iterators in boost, and as for <a href=""http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_37_0/libs/range/doc/boost_range.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">this reference</a>, it seems there should be an easy way of doing what I want, but it's not obvious to me.</p>

<p>Say I want to represent a numerical range, 0 to 100 (inclusive or not), say <code>range(0,100)</code>. I would like to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>for_each(range&lt;int&gt;(0,100).begin(), range&lt;int&gt;(0,100).end(), do_something);

<p>where <code>do_something</code> is a functor. This iterators shouldn't have the overhead of having an underneath vector or something like this, but to just offer a sequence of integers. Is this possible with the range implementation in boost? Possible at all with normal, standard STL iterators?</p>

"UriBuilder().Query will wrongly encode non-ASCII characters","<p>I am working on an asp.net mvc 4 web application. and i am using .net 4.5. now i have the following <code>WebClient()</code> class:</p>

<pre><code>using (var client = new WebClient())
{
    var query = HttpUtility.ParseQueryString(string.Empty);

    query[""model""] = Model;
    //code goes here for other parameters....

    string apiurl = System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings[""ApiURL""];
    var url = new UriBuilder(apiurl);
    url.Query = query.ToString();

    string xml = client.DownloadString(url.ToString());
    XmlDocument doc = new XmlDocument();
    //code goes here ....

}
</code></pre>

<p>now i have noted a problem when one of the parameters contain non-ASCII charterers such as <code>£</code>, <code>¬</code>, etc.... </p>

<p>now the final query will have any non-ASCII characters (such as <code>£</code>) encoded wrongly (as <code>%u00a3</code>). i read about this problem and seems i can replace :-</p>

<pre><code>url.Query = query.ToString();
</code></pre>

<p>with</p>

<pre><code>url.Query = ri.EscapeUriString(HttpUtility.UrlDecode(query.ToString()));    
</code></pre>

<p>now using the later approach will encode <code>£</code> as <code>%C2%A3</code> which is the correct encoded value.</p>

<p>but the problem i am facing with <code>url.Query = Uri.EscapeUriString(HttpUtility.UrlDecode(query.ToString()));</code> in that case one of the parameters contains <code>&amp;</code> then the url will have the following format   <code>&amp;operation=AddAsset&amp;assetName=&amp;....</code> so it will assume that I am passing empty assetName  parameter not value =<code>&amp;</code>??   </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>

<p>Let me summarize my problem again. I want to be able to pass the following 3 things inside my URL to a third part API :</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Standard characters such as A,B ,a ,b ,1, 2, 3 ...</p></li>
<li><p>Non-ASCII characters such as <code>£</code>,<code>¬</code> .</p></li>
<li><p>and also special characters that are used in url encoding such as <code>&amp;</code> , <code>+</code> .</p></li>
</ol>

<p>now i tried the following 2 approaches :</p>

<p><strong>Approach A</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>using (var client = new WebClient())
{
    var query = HttpUtility.ParseQueryString(string.Empty);

    query[""model""] = Model;
    //code goes here for other parameters....

    string apiurl = System.Web.Configuration.WebConfigurationManager.AppSettings[""ApiURL""];
    var url = new UriBuilder(apiurl);
    url.Query = query.ToString();

    string xml = client.DownloadString(url.ToString());
    XmlDocument doc = new XmlDocument();
    //code goes here ....

}
</code></pre>

<p>In this approach i can pass values such as <code>&amp;</code> ,<code>+</code> since they are going to be url encoded ,,but if i want to pass non-ASCII characters they will be encoded using ISO-8859-1 ... so if i have <code>£</code> value , my above code will encoded as <code>%u00a3</code> and it will be saved inside the 3rd party API as <code>%u00a3</code> instead of <code>£</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Approach B :</strong></p>

<p>I use :</p>

<pre><code>url.Query = Uri.EscapeUriString(HttpUtility.UrlDecode(query.ToString())); 
</code></pre>

<p>instead of</p>

<pre><code>url.Query = query.ToString();
</code></pre>

<p>now I can pass non-ASCII characters such as <code>£</code> since they will be encoded correctly using UTF8 instead of ISO-8859-1. but i can not pass values such as <code>&amp;</code> because my url will be read wrongly by the 3rd party API.. for example if I want to pass <code>assetName=&amp;</code> my url will look as follow:</p>

<pre><code>&amp;operation=Add&amp;assetName=&amp;
</code></pre>

<p>so the third part API will assume I am passing empty <code>assetName</code>, while I am trying to pass its value as &amp;...</p>

<p>so not sure how I can pass both non-ASCII characters  + characters such as <code>&amp;</code>, <code>+</code> ????</p>

"Smallest substring that can be replaced to make the string have the same number of each character","<p>I'm trying to solve a problem that is almost exactly that. In particular I'm given a string <code>s</code> such that <code>s.Length % 4 == 0</code> and each <code>s[i]</code> is one of <code>'A'</code>, <code>'C'</code>, <code>'T'</code> or <code>'G'</code>. I want to find the smallest substring that I can replace so that each of <code>'A'</code>, <code>'C'</code>, <code>'T'</code> and <code>'G'</code> appears exactly <code>s.Length / 4</code> times. </p>

<p>For example, with <code>s=""GAAATAAA""</code>, one optimal solution is to replace a substring <code>""AAATA""</code> with <code>""TTCCG""</code>, resulting in <code>""GTTCCGAA""</code>.</p>

"How to suppress Java compiler warnings for specific functions","<p>We are always taught to make sure we use a <em>break</em> in switch statements to avoid fall-through.</p>

<p>The Java compiler warns about these situations to help us not make trivial (but drastic) errors.</p>

<p>I have, however, used case fall-through as a feature (we don't have to get into it here, but it provides a very elegant solution). </p>

<p>However the compiler spits out massive amounts of warnings that may obscure warnings that I need to know about.

"How do I call a database function using SQLAlchemy in Flask?","<p>I want to call a function that I created in my PostgreSQL database. I've looked at the official SQLAlchemy documentation as well as several questions here on SO, but nobody seems to explain how to set up the function in SQLAlchemy.</p>

<p>I did find <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15293547/named-parameters-in-database-functions-with-sqlalchemy"">this question</a>, but am unsure how to compile the function as the answer suggests. Where does that code go? I get errors when I try to put this in both my view and model scripts.</p>

<p><strong>Edit 1 (8/11/2016)</strong></p>

<p>As per the community's requests and requirements, here are all the details I left out:</p>

<p>I have a table called books whose columns are arranged with information regarding the general book (title, author(s), publication date...).</p>

<p>I then have many tables all of the same kind whose columns contain information regarding all the chapters in each book (chapter name, length, short summary...). <strong>It is absolutely necessary for each book to have its own table.</strong> I have played around with one large table of all the chapters, and found it ill suited to my needs, not too mention extremely unwieldy. </p>

<p>My function that I'm asking about queries the table of books for an individual book's name, and casts the book's name to a regclass. It then queries the regclass object for all its data, returns all the rows as a table like the individual book tables, and exits. Here's the raw code:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.get_book(bookName character varying)
 RETURNS TABLE(/*columns of individual book table go here*/)
 LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $function$
declare
    _tbl regclass;
begin
    for _tbl in
        select name::regclass
        from books
        where name=bookName
    loop
        return query execute '
        select * from ' ||_tbl;
    end loop;
end;
$function$
</code></pre>

<p>This function has been tested several times in both the command line and pgAdmin. It works as expected.</p>

<p>My intention is to have a view in my Flask app whose route is <code>@app.route('/book/&lt;string:bookName&gt;')</code> and calls the above function before rendering the template. The exact view is as follows:</p>

<pre><code>@app.route('/book/&lt;string:bookName&gt;')
def book(bookName):
  chapterList = /*call function here*/
  return render_template('book.html', book=bookName, list=chapterList)
</code></pre>

<p>This is my question: how do I set up my app in such a way that SQLAlchemy knows about and can call the function I have in my database? I am open to other suggestions of achieving the same result as well.</p>

<p>P.S. I only omitted this information with the intention of keeping my question as abstract as possible, not knowing that the rules of the forum dictate a requirement for a very specific question. Please forgive me my lack of knowledge.</p>

<p>I would like to be able to pair this small Bluetooth device to the iPhone only once and be able for it to be in sleep mode (500 nano amps :D awesome) and when I turn it on (via a small switch) it will open an app and send that message. (the app is already done, you just have to press a button on the app in order to send the message, that's why I would like to use a Bluetooth device so you don't have to have the app open at all times!)</p>

<p>Sorry for the long paragraph but I need help! I have the Bluegiga BLE113 dev kit and im overwhelmed with all the information they give you! But I don't see anywhere where I connect to the iPhone and do what I want to do.</p>

"Serving Python (Flask) REST API over HTTP2","<p>I have a Python REST service and I want to serve it using HTTP2. My current server setup is <code>nginx -&gt; Gunicorn</code>. In other words, nginx (port 443 and 80 that redirects to port 443) is running as a reverse proxy and forwards requests to Gunicorn (port 8000, no SSL). nginx is running in HTTP2 mode and I can verify that by using chrome and inspecting the 'protocol' column after sending a simple GET to the server. However, Gunicorn reports that the requests it receives are HTTP1.0. Also, I coulnt't find it in this list:
<a href=""https://github.com/http2/http2-spec/wiki/Implementations"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.com/http2/http2-spec/wiki/Implementations</a>
So, my questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is it possible to serve a Python (Flask) application with HTTP2? If yes, which servers support it?</li>
<li>In my case (one reverse proxy server and one serving the actual API), which server has to support HTTP2?</li>
</ul>

<p>The reason I want to use HTTP2 is because in some cases I need to perform thousands of requests all together and I was interested to see if the multiplexed requests feature of HTTP2 can speed things up. With HTTP1.0 and Python Requests as the client, each request takes ~80ms which is unacceptable. The other solution would be to just bulk/batch my REST resources and send multiple with a single requests. Yes, this idea sounds just fine, but I am really interested to see if HTTP2 could speed things up.</p>

<p>Finally, I should mention that for the client side I use Python Requests with the Hyper http2 adapter.</p>

"Using Gson instead of Jackson in Spring Webflux","<p>We have many Spring MVC projects already, which all use gson instead of jackson for response body encode. Our bean classes are all written based on gson annotation. Now I am setting up a Spring Webflux restful server. It would save a lot of work if we can use the old bean classes from our Spring MVC projects.</p>

<p>I have tried <code>spring.http.converters.preferred-json-mapper=gson</code> property to no avail.</p>

<p>I have tried <code>HttpMessageConverter</code> bean, which is included in webflux packages, but that does not work as in the Spring MVC projects.</p>

<p>I googled a lot and the only thing helpful is to implement <code>org.springframework.http.codec.HttpMessageEncoder</code> class and set it to <code>WebFluxConfigurer.configureHttpMessageCodecs()</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>@Configuration
public class WebConfiguration implements WebFluxConfigurer {
    @Override
    public void configureHttpMessageCodecs(ServerCodecConfigurer configurer) {
        configurer.customCodecs().decoder(new GsonHttpMessageDecoder());
        configurer.customCodecs().encoder(new GsonHttpMessageEncoder());

    }
}

"JPA/hibernate sorted collection @OrderBy vs @Sort","<p>I would like to have a collection of child objects (here cat-kitten example) that are ordered.  And keep their order on adding of new elements.</p>

<pre><code>@Entity

  @OrderBy(""name ASC"")
  private List&lt;Kitten&gt; kittens;

  public void setKittens(List&lt;Kitten&gt; kittens) { this.kittens = kittens; }
  public List&lt;Kitten&gt; getKittens() { return kittens; } 
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I do <code>cat.getKittens.add(newKitten)</code> the order by name will be broken. </p>

<p>Is it possible to let hibernate do the work of keeping the collection always ordered? By using the <a href=""http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/core/3.5/javadocs/org/hibernate/annotations/Sort.html"">@Sort hibernate</a> annotation?<br>
@Sort has the disadvantage that it forces you to implement Comparable interface ...
What would be the right 'pure JPA' way to do that? Saving everything to DB and reloading it?
Makes it sense to combine @OrderBy and @Sort?</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>
Solution up to now is to combine @OrderBy and @Sort. @OrderBy leads to a <code>ORDER BY</code> clause in the generated SQL which is better for performance (I assume that java is ""sorting"" again on inserting into the sorted container, but that should be much faster because the elements are already sorted)
@Sort together with an implemented <code>Comparable</code> interface leads to a always sorted container. Note that I use now <code>SortedSet</code> instead of <code>List</code>. Here the updated Code:</p>

<pre><code>@Entity 
public class Cat {
  @OneToMany(mappedBy = ""cat"", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
  @OrderBy(""name ASC"")
  @Sort(type = SortType.NATURAL)
  private SortedSet&lt;Kitten&gt; kittens;

  public void setKittens(SortedSet&lt;Kitten&gt; kittens) { this.kittens = kittens; }

"Is History API consistent across modern browsers?","<p>History API is now <a href=""http://caniuse.com/#search=history"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">supported in every popular browser</a>. It seems there's no need for hash fallbacks, <code>_escaped_fragment_</code> tricks or <a href=""https://github.com/browserstate/history.js/wiki/Intelligent-State-Handling"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">other workarounds</a> anymore. Cool libraries from 2013 like <a href=""https://github.com/browserstate/history.js/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">History.js</a> seem useless now. But there are some things where I'm not sure - for example <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26324990/title-of-history-pushstate-is-unsupported-whats-a-good-alternative"">title handling seems tricky</a> beacuse apparently <code>title</code> argument in <code>pushState</code> doesn't do anything.</p>

<p>My question is, can I actually rely on the History API to behave consistently across browsers, or do I still need some browser-specific code?

"SSL session persistence and secure cookies","<p>I currently have a roll-your-own application security service that runs in my enterprise and is - for the most part - meeting business needs.</p>

<p>The issue that I currently face is that the service has traditionally (naively) relied on the user's source IP remaining constant as a hedge against session hijacking - the web applications in the enterprise are not directly available to the public and it was in the past perfectly acceptable for me to require that a users' address remain constant throughout a given session.</p>

<p>Unfortunately this is no longer the case and I am therefore forced to switch to a solution that does not rely on the source IP. I would much prefer to implement a solution that actually accomplishes the original designer's intent (i.e. preventing session hijacking).</p>

<p>My research so far has turned up <a href=""http://www.cse.msu.edu/~alexliu/publications/Cookie/cookie.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a>, which essentially says ""salt your authentication token hash with the SSL session key.""</p>

<p>On the face of it, this seems like a perfect solution, however I am left with a nagging suspicion that real-world implementation of this scheme is impractical due to the possibility that the client and server can at any time - effectively arbitrarily - opt to re-negotiate the SSL session and therefore change the key. </p>

<p>this is the scenario I am envisioning:</p>

<ol>
<li>SSL session established and key agreed upon.</li>
<li>Client authenticates to server at the application level (i.e. via username and password).</li>
<li>Server writes a secure cookie that includes SSL session key.</li>
<li><em>Something</em> occurs that causes a session re-negotiation. For example, I think IE does this on a timer with or without a reason.</li>
<li>Client submits a request to the server containing the <em>old</em> session key (since there was no application level knowledge of the re-negotiation there was no opportunity for a new, updated hash to be written to the client).</li>
<li>Server rejects client's credential due to hash match failure, etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>Is this a real issue or is this a misapprehension on my part due to a (to say the least) less-than-perfect understanding of how SSL works?</p>

"Servlet 3.0 annotations in conjuction with Guice","<p>I am attempting to update a legacy Guice application, and I was wondering if there is any sort of preferred way of doing things when taking Servlet 3.0 annotations into consideration.  For example, my application has a filter, FooFilter, which is defined in the Guice Module Factory method configureServlets(), as follows:</p>

<pre><code>    Map&lt;String, String&gt; fooParams = new HashMap&lt;String, String&gt;();
    fooParams.put(""someParam"", ""parameter information"");                              
    filter(""/foo.jsp"",""/foo/*"").through(com.example.filter.FooFilter.class, fooParams);
</code></pre>

<p>Is the above binding still necessary, or will it interfere with the following using the @WebFilter Servlet 3.0 annotation:</p>

<pre><code>    @Singleton
    @WebFilter(
        filterName=""FooFilter"",
        urlPatterns={""/foo.jsp"", ""/foo/*""},
        initParams = {
                    @WebInitParam(name=""foo"", value=""Hello ""),
                    @WebInitParam(name=""bar"", value="" World!"")
                 })
    public class FooFilter implements Filter {
    etc....
</code></pre>

"Why is some code Deterministic in Python2 and Non-Deterministic in Python 3?","<p>I'm trying to write a script to calculate all of the possible fuzzy string match matches to for a short string, or 'kmer', and the same code that works in Python 2.7.X gives me a non-deterministic answer with Python 3.3.X, and I can't figure out why.</p>

<p>I iterate over a dictionary, itertools.product, and itertools.combinations in my code, but I iterate over all of them to completion with no breaks or continues.  In addition, I store all of my results in a separate dictionary instead of the one I'm iterating over.  In short - I'm not making any mistakes that are obvious to me, so why is the behavior different between Python2 and Python3?</p>

<p>Sample, slightly simplified code below:</p>

    for kmer, value in kmers.items():
        for similar_kmer in permute_string( kmer, m ):

def permute_string( query, m ):

"Static methods vs instance methods in C#","<p>For an application I am writing, I want to have extreme extensibility and extension methods seem to give me what I want, plus the ability to call them without an instance, which I need too.</p>

<p>I remember reading that static methods are faster than instance methods but don't get the advantages of GC. Is this correct?</p>

<p>It's highly unlikely I will change my design unless I find a superior alternative by design not speed. But still for extra information I wanna know the differences in speed, GC, etc.</p>

<p>EDIT: Thanks. More info: Let's say we have a Person class:</p>

<pre><code>class Person
</code></pre>

<p>which can have an instance Distance method so like:</p>

<pre><code>this.Distance (Person p)
</code></pre>

<p>This is great, but this doesn't give me the ability to calculate the distance between 2 points (say Point3), without creating instances of the Person class.</p>

<p>What I want to do is this:</p>

<pre><code>class Person (no Distance methods)
</code></pre>

<p>but extension methods of Distance:</p>

<pre><code>Distance (this Person, Person)
Distance (this Point3, Point3)

<p>This way I can both do:</p>

<pre><code>myPerson.Distance (yourPerson)

<p>and</p>

This is because, looking at the Spring implementation for <code>AsyncResult</code> here: <a href=""https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/master/spring-context/src/main/java/org/springframework/scheduling/annotation/AsyncResult.java#L71"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/master/spring-context/src/main/java/org/springframework/scheduling/annotation/AsyncResult.java#L71</a> , this method doesn't actually do a single thing. It simply returns false, that the thread could not be cancelled. This is my problem. How can I cancel the Thread being created by the <code>@Async</code> method? I have no access to the internal thread being created by Spring - so I have no means myself with which to cancel it, do I?</p>

Libp2p is a networking stack modularized out of <a href=""http://ipfs.io/"" rel=""noreferrer"">IPFS</a> project.</p>

<p>Libp2p allows me to build <code>nodes</code> which are capable of hosting a <code>swarm</code> or <code>listening/ dialing</code> to one. I have developed to the point where several nodes can communicate with each other via inputs in angularjs (supplemented by socket.io) webpage but their IP addresses and <code>tcp</code> ports need to be hard coded.</p>

<p>The problem I am facing is, if an unknown number of users join this system and set up their nodes, how do I handle the scenario. I have done lot of research into <code>DHT</code> specifically into its application with torrents but am no where close to actually applying it.</p>

<p>I do not want to run a central system that keeps track of the users as a tracker keeps track of seeders and leachers in torrents (now somewhat redundant due to DHT)</p>

<p>In a centralized chat application, every time a user enters or leaves, I can send an emit event from the server to all peers using socket.io signaling the same. But the equivalent in a decentralized chat app is something I am struggling with greatly.</p>

"How to create MS Paint clone with Python and pygame","<p>As I see it, there are two ways to handle mouse events to draw a picture.</p>

<p>The first is to detect when the mouse moves and draw a line to where the mouse is, shown <a href=""http://www.cs.iupui.edu/~aharris/pygame/ch05/paint.py"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>.  However, the problem with this is that  with a large brush size, many gaps appear between each ""line"" that is not straight since it is using the line's stroke size to create thick lines.</p>

"How to configure and enable Azure Service Fabric Reverse Proxy for an existing on-premises cluster?","<p>Is the Azure Service Fabric Reverse Proxy available in an on-premises cluster? If so, how can I enable it for an existing cluster?</p>

<p>The Service Fabric Reverse Proxy is described <a href=""https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/service-fabric-reverseproxy/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>. It allows clients external to the cluster to access application services by name with a special URL,  without needing to know the exact host:port on which an instance of the service is running (which may change as services are automatically moved around).  </p>

<p>By default the Service Fabric Reverse Proxy does not appear to be enabled for my on-prem cluster with two instances of a stateless service. I tried using the <a href=""https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/service-fabric-reverseproxy/"" rel=""noreferrer"">documented</a> port 19008 but could not reach the service using the recommended URI syntax.</p>

<p>To wit, this works: </p>

I am guessing that the needed configuration is specified somehow in the cluster config JSON. There are instructions in the <a href=""https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/service-fabric-reverseproxy/"" rel=""noreferrer"">referenced article</a> that explain how to configure the reverse proxy in the cloud, but not on-premises.</p>

"Like and Share buttons in webpage cause javascript warnings and php error","<p>I have added basic Facebook ""Like/Share"" buttons to a webpage, using code copied directly from the Facebook Developers page. There are 2 parts to the code: a javascript block and a div tag with a class of ""fb-like""  Heres the javascript:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=""fb-root""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script&gt;(function(d, s, id) {
  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];
  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;
  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;
  js.src = ""//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1"";
  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);
}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And here's the div tag for where I want the buttons to appear:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class=""fb-like"" data-href=""http://www.bethcake.com"" data-width=""90"" data-layout=""button_count"" data-action=""like"" data-show-faces=""false"" data-share=""true""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here are the problems I'm encountering:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>When the webpage loads, I get 2 javascript warnings. The warnings refer to the connect.facebook.net source code, line 233, not any code I've written. They are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Invalid App Id: Must be a number or numeric string representing the application id.</li>
<li>FB.getLoginStatus() called before calling FB.init().</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Also on page load, I get a php error (like.php.1:948):</p>

<ul>
<li>Blocked a frame with origin ""<a href=""http://www.facebook.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.facebook.com</a>"" from accessing a frame with origin ""<a href=""http://www.bethcake.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.bethcake.com</a>"". Protocols, domains, and ports must match.</li>
</ul>

<p>This error is puzzling. First of all, I'm not using frames.  Second, the protocols do match and there is nothing here about ports. Of course the domains don't match: I'm not trying to collect ""Likes"" for a Facebook page; I want to get ""Likes"" for an external website page. Am I missing something?</p></li>
<li><p>I ran the URL through the Facebook Open Graph Object Debugger.  It brought up a number of warnings I don't understand. They are:</p>

<ul>
<li>fb:admins and fb:app_id tags are missing.</li>
<li>og:title, og:type, and og:image are missing.</li>
<li>og:url, go:title, go:description, and go:image properties should be explicitly provided</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Okay, fine. But where and how am I supposed to add these? I've looked through the Facebook documentation and searched stackoverflow, without success.  If these are supposed to be added to the data-href string in the div tag, please give me an example.</p>

<p>I want to sort them out in the ascending order of the dates (based on the month, day, and year). What's the best way to do that?</p>

<pre><code>Array
[

    ['2008-03-06']='some text'
]

<p>Perhaps when its in this format, I can loop through them, remove all the <code>'-'</code> (hyphen) marks so they are left as integars, sort them using <code>array_sort()</code> and loop through them yet again to sort them? Would prefer if there was another way as I'd be doing 3 loops with this per user.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Edit: I could also do this:</p>

<pre><code>$array[$index]=array('human'=&gt;'28 Feb, 2009',
                   'db'=&gt;'20080228',
                   'description'=&gt;'Some text here');

"Dependency graph of Visual Studio projects","<p>I'm currently migrating a big solution (~70 projects) from VS 2005 + .NET 2.0 to VS 2008 + .NET 3.5. Currently I have VS 2008 + .NET 2.0.</p>

<p>The problem is that I need to move projects one by one to new .NET framework ensuring that no .NET 2.0 project references .NET 3.5 project. Is there any tool that would give me a nice graph of project dependencies?</p>

"PhoneGap Build Plugins not functioning","<p>I am building a PhoneGap Build app and I will be requiring some plugins. I have followed the docs yet none are working. Since none of them are working I suppose it's a common problem. Here's the plugins in the <code>config.xml</code> file:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- Plugins --&gt;  
&lt;gap:plugin name=&quot;org.apache.cordova.device&quot; /&gt; &lt;!-- Device plugin --&gt;  
&lt;gap:plugin name=&quot;com.phonegap.plugin.statusbar&quot; /&gt; &lt;!-- Status bar plugin --&gt;  
&lt;gap:plugin name=&quot;com.verso.cordova.clipboard&quot; /&gt; &lt;!-- Clipboard plugin --&gt;  
&lt;gap:plugin name=&quot;com.chariotsolutions.cordova.plugin.keyboard_toolbar_remover&quot; /&gt; &lt;!-- Keyboard toolbar removal plugin --&gt;  
&lt;gap:plugin name=&quot;org.apache.cordova.splashscreen&quot; /&gt; &lt;!-- Splashscreen plugin --&gt;  
&lt;gap:plugin name=&quot;org.apache.cordova.vibration&quot; /&gt; &lt;!-- Vibration plugin --&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Here's the links in the <code>index.html</code> file (if there's a problem my best guess is that it will be here):</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- PhoneGap Build --&gt;  
&lt;script src=&quot;phonegap.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  
&lt;script src=&quot;device.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  
&lt;script src=&quot;statusbar.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  
&lt;script src=&quot;clipboard.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  
&lt;script src=&quot;keyboard_toolbar_remover.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  
&lt;script src=&quot;splashscreen.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;  
&lt;script src=&quot;vibration.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>None are working except the device plugin (firing the 'deviceready' event).</p>
<p>Here's some code from the javascript file:</p>
<pre><code>document.addEventListener(&quot;deviceready&quot;, function(e) {  
   // Hiding the status bar as even the fullscreen preference in config.xml isn't working
    StatusBar.hide();  
    window.setTimeout(function() {   
        // Trying to hide the splash screen which also doesn't work (or even show) properly from config.xml
        navigator.splashscreen.hide();  
    }, 4000); 
}, &quot;false&quot;);  
</code></pre>
<p>I tested this function with an alert and I can assure you that it does get called. Here's some more:</p>
<pre><code>// This is for the clipboard plugin  
function handleCopyAndPaste() {  
    $(&quot;.copyButton&quot;).click(function() {  
        window.plugins.clipboard.copy($(&quot;#result&quot;).val());  
    });  
    $(&quot;.pasteButton&quot;).click(function() {  
        window.plugins.clipboard.paste(function (text) {   
            $(&quot;#convertThis&quot;).val(text);  
            convert();  
        });  
    });  
} 
</code></pre>
<p>This is for vibrations:</p>
<pre><code>navigator.notification.vibrate(2500);
</code></pre>
<p>This is for hiding the keyboard toolbar once an input field called <code>#convertThis</code> has <code>focus()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$(&quot;#convertThis&quot;).focus(function() {
    toolbar.hide()
});
</code></pre>
<p>I tried removing the js links in <code>index.html</code> yet still nothing. I also tried putting the plugin tags outside the widget tag in <code>config.xml</code> and... NOTHING! Weirdly enough, the plugins tab in PhoneGap Build dashboards says none are installed:</p>

"Cannot use old NDK (android-ndk-r17c) after Catalina upgrade due to new security","<p>After upgrading to macOS Catalina, my project won't build anymore. This is due to Catalina believing the binaries in 'android-ndk-r17c' to not be from a trusted developer.</p>

<p>You get messages such as: 
""“ld” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.""
""macOS cannot verify that this app is free from malware""</p>

<p>I have to use the old NDK due to problems with native openCV library SDK and newer NDKs. They are working on it, but the newer SDK is not stable enough for me yet.</p>

<p>I was able to get around ""clang"" and ""clang++"" not being able to work by going to the security pane and clicking ""Allow Anyway"" on the security alerts. However, when trying this with ""Id"", I can get past the first warning by clicking ""Allow Anyway"" but it seems to be called subsequently and on the subsequent call I do not have the option to allow it to open.</p>

"Should thread-safe class have a memory barrier at the end of its constructor?","<p>When implementing a class intended to be thread-safe, should I include a memory barrier at the end of its constructor, in order to ensure that any internal structures have completed being initialized before they can be accessed? Or is it the responsibility of the consumer to insert the memory barrier before making the instance available to other threads?</p>
<p><strong>Simplified question</strong>:</p>
<p>Is there a race hazard in the code below that could give erroneous behaviour due to the lack of a memory barrier between the initialization and the access of the thread-safe class? Or should the thread-safe class itself protect against this?</p>
<pre><code>ConcurrentQueue&lt;int&gt; queue = null;

Parallel.Invoke(
    () =&gt; queue = new ConcurrentQueue&lt;int&gt;(),
    () =&gt; queue?.Enqueue(5));
</code></pre>
<p>Note that it is acceptable for the program to enqueue nothing, as would happen if the second delegate executes before the first. (The null-conditional operator <code>?.</code> protects against a <code>NullReferenceException</code> here.) However, it should not be acceptable for the program to throw an <code>IndexOutOfRangeException</code>, <code>NullReferenceException</code>, enqueue <code>5</code> multiple times, get stuck in an infinite loop, or do any of the other weird things caused by race hazards on internal structures.</p>
<p><strong>Elaborated question</strong>:</p>
<p>Concretely, imagine that I were implementing a simple thread-safe wrapper for a queue. (I'm aware that .NET already provides <a href=""https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd267265(v=vs.110).aspx"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>ConcurrentQueue&lt;T&gt;</code></a>; this is just an example.) I could write:</p>
<pre><code>public class ThreadSafeQueue&lt;T&gt;
{
    private readonly Queue&lt;T&gt; _queue;

    public ThreadSafeQueue()
    {
        _queue = new Queue&lt;T&gt;();

        // Thread.MemoryBarrier(); // Is this line required?
    }

    public void Enqueue(T item)
    {
        lock (_queue)
        {
            _queue.Enqueue(item);
        }
    }

    public bool TryDequeue(out T item)
    {
        lock (_queue)
        {
            if (_queue.Count == 0)
            {
                item = default(T);
                return false;
            }

            item = _queue.Dequeue();
            return true;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This implementation is thread-safe, once initialized. However, if the initialization itself is raced by another consumer thread, then race hazards could arise, whereby the latter thread would access the instance before the internal <code>Queue&lt;T&gt;</code> has been initialized. As a contrived example:</p>
<pre><code>ThreadSafeQueue&lt;int&gt; queue = null;

Parallel.For(0, 10000, i =&gt;
{
    if (i == 0)
        queue = new ThreadSafeQueue&lt;int&gt;();
    else if (i % 2 == 0)
        queue?.Enqueue(i);
    else
    {
        int item = -1;
        if (queue?.TryDequeue(out item) == true)
            Console.WriteLine(item);
    }
});
</code></pre>
<p>It is acceptable for the code above to miss some numbers; however, without the memory barrier, it could also be getting a <code>NullReferenceException</code> (or some other weird result) due to the internal <code>Queue&lt;T&gt;</code> not having been initialized by the time that <code>Enqueue</code> or <code>TryDequeue</code> are called.</p>
<p>Is it the responsibility of the thread-safe class to include a memory barrier at the end of its constructor, or is it the consumer who should include a memory barrier between the class's instantiation and its visibility to other threads? What is the convention in the .NET Framework for classes marked as thread-safe?</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: This is an advanced threading topic, so I understand the confusion in some of the comments. An instance <em>can</em> appear as half-baked if accessed from other threads without proper synchronization. This topic is discussed extensively within the context of double-checked locking, which is broken under the ECMA CLI specification without the use of memory barriers (such as through <code>volatile</code>). Per <a href=""http://csharpindepth.com/Articles/General/Singleton.aspx#dcl"" rel=""noreferrer"">Jon Skeet</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The Java memory model doesn't ensure that the constructor completes before the reference to the new object is assigned to instance</strong>. The Java memory model underwent a reworking for version 1.5, but double-check locking is still broken after this without a volatile variable (<strong>as in C#</strong>).</p>
<p>Without any memory barriers, it's broken in the ECMA CLI specification too. It's possible that under the .NET 2.0 memory model (which is stronger than the ECMA spec) it's safe, but I'd rather not rely on those stronger semantics, especially if there's any doubt as to the safety.</p>

"Kappa architecture: when insert to batch/analytic serving layer happens","<p>As you know, Kappa architecture is some kind of simplification of Lambda architecture. Kappa doesn't need batch layer, instead speed layer have to guarantee computation precision and enough throughput (more parallelism/resources) on historical data re-computation.</p>

<p>Still Kappa architecture requires two serving layers in case when you need to do analytic based on historical data. For example, data that have age &lt; 2 weeks are stored at Redis (streaming serving layer), while all older data are stored somewhere at HBase (batch serving layer).</p>

<p><em>When (due to Kappa architecture) I have to insert data to batch serving layer?</em> 
If streaming layer inserts data immidiately to both batch &amp; stream serving layers - than how about late data arrival? Or streaming layer should backup speed serving layer to batch serving layer on regular basis?</p>

<hr>

<p>Example: let say source of data is Kafka, data are processed by Spark Structured Streaming or Flink, sinks are Redis and HBase. When write to Redis &amp; HBase should happen?</p>

"How to serve .flv files using PHP?","<p>I'm building a streaming video site. The idea is that the customers should pay for a membership, login to the system, and be able to view the videos. I'm going with <a href=""http://flowplayer.org"" rel=""noreferrer"">FlowPlayer</a> for showing the actual videos.</p>

<p>The problem now is, the videos need to be stored somewhere publically and the url to the .flv files needs to be passed to flowplayer for it to be able to show them. This creates a problem because anyone can do a view source, download the video, and distribute it all across the internet.</p>

<p>I know some people serve images using php by doing an image <code>header()</code> and then they can do something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src=""image.php?userId=1828&amp;img=test.gif"" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>The php script validates the user ID and serves up the .gif and the actual url of the gif is never revealed.</p>

<p>Is there anyway to do this with .flv or any other video format also? E.g, the file and user ID passed onto the PHP script, it validates them, and returns the video?</p>

"Laravel Model Factory without connection to database","<p>I would like to use Laravel's Model Factory in some PHPUnit tests. The only thing I want to do is make a Model instance without saving it to database.</p>

<p>Why the Model Factory needs connection to database? These tests must pass on CI environment without configured database.</p>

<p>When I create Model manually by <code>new App\Model($dataArray)</code>, tests pass and the connection is not needed.</p>

"How to check if a number is a power of 2","<p>Today I needed a simple algorithm for checking if a number is a power of 2.</p>
<p>The algorithm needs to be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Simple</li>
<li>Correct for any <code>ulong</code> value.</li>
</ol>
<p>I came up with this simple algorithm:</p>
<pre><code>private bool IsPowerOfTwo(ulong number)
{
    if (number == 0)
        return false;

    for (ulong power = 1; power &gt; 0; power = power &lt;&lt; 1)
    {
        // This for loop used shifting for powers of 2, meaning
        // that the value will become 0 after the last shift
        // (from binary 1000...0000 to 0000...0000) then, the 'for'
        // loop will break out.

        if (power == number)
            return true;
        if (power &gt; number)
            return false;
    }
    return false;
}
</code></pre>
<p>But then I thought: How about checking if log<sub>2</sub> x is an exactly a round number? When I checked for 2^63+1, <code>Math.Log()</code> returned exactly 63 because of rounding. So I checked if 2 to the power 63 is equal to the original number and it is, because the calculation is done in <code>double</code>s and not in exact numbers.</p>
<pre><code>private bool IsPowerOfTwo_2(ulong number)
{
    double log = Math.Log(number, 2);
    double pow = Math.Pow(2, Math.Round(log));
    return pow == number;
}

<pre><code>try {

<p>The problem was difficult to troubleshoot because doSomeStuff() threw an exception, which in turn caused doSomeOtherStuff() to also throw an exception.  The second exception (thrown by the finally block) was thrown up to my code, but it did not have a handle on the first exception (thrown from doSomeStuff()), which was the real root-cause of the problem.</p>

"Command line command to auto-kill a command after a certain amount of time","<p>I'd like to automatically kill a command after a certain amount of time.  I have in mind an interface like this:</p>

<pre><code>% constrain 300 ./foo args

<p>Which would run ""./foo"" with ""args"" but automatically kill it if it's still running after 5 minutes.</p>

<p>Are there any existing tools that do that, or has anyone written such a thing?</p>

<p>ADDED: Jonathan's solution is precisely what I had in mind and it works like a charm on linux, but I can't get it to work on Mac OSX.  I got rid of the SIGRTMIN which lets it compile fine, but the signal just doesn't get sent to the child process.  Anyone know how to make this work on Mac?</p>

"What is the performance cost of assigning a single string value using +'s","<p>I have often wondered this, is there a performance cost of splitting a string over multiple lines to increase readability when initially assigning a value to a string. I know that strings are immutable and therefore a new string needs to be created every time. Also, the performance cost is actually irrelevant thanks to today's really fast hardware (unless you are in some diabolical loop). So for example:</p>

<pre><code>String newString = ""This is a really long long long long long"" +
    "" long long long long long long long long long long long long "" +
    "" long long long long long long long long long string for example."";
</code></pre>

<p>How does the JVM or .Net's compiler and other optimizations handle this. Will it create a single string? Or will it create 1 string then a new concatenating the value and then another one concatenating the values again?</p>

"UIScrollView with centered UIImageView, like Photos app","<p>I would like to have scroll view with an image content view. The image is actually map which is much bigger than the screen. The map should be initially in the center of the scroll view, like photos in Photos app when you turn iPhone to landscape orientation.</p>

<p><img src=""https://lh4.ggpht.com/_bowYsy0VxgU/Sbj0Vjz5twI/AAAAAAAAAy0/CHM6LRsNkTo/scrollView.png"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>I did not manage to have the map in the center with correct zooming and scrolling at the same time.
Provided that the map image starts from the top of the screen (in portrait orientation), the code looks something like:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)loadView {
    mapView = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@""map.jpg""]];
    CGFloat mapHeight = MAP_HEIGHT * SCREEN_WIDTH / MAP_WIDTH;
    mapView.frame = CGRectMake(0, 0, SCREEN_WIDTH, mapHeight);
    scrollView = [[UIScrollView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, SCREEN_WIDTH, SCREEN_HEIGHT)];
    scrollView.delegate = self;
    scrollView.contentSize = mapView.frame.size;
    scrollView.maximumZoomScale = MAP_WIDTH / SCREEN_WIDTH;
    scrollView.minimumZoomScale = 1;
    [scrollView addSubview:mapView];
    self.view = scrollView;
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I move the image frame to the center, the image grows only from the top of its frame down. I tried to play around with mapView transform, with dynamically changing frame of the imageView. Nothing works for me so far.</p>

"Migrating from eclipse + SVN to Android Studio","<p>We currently use Eclipse for Android development , and our projects are synchronized to an SVN .</p>

<p>Current structure :</p>

<ul>
<li>Android Application 1</li>
<li>Android Application 2</li>
<li>Android library 1</li>
<li>Android library 2</li>
</ul>

<p>It is therefore independent projects on SVN.</p>

<p>Details :</p>

<p>Android Android app 1 need library 1
Android Android app 2 need library 1 and 2 , etc ...</p>

<p>Until then, it is quite normal.</p>

<p>The challenge is to move to the project structure in Android Studio / IntelliJ , while ensuring compatibility with eclipse . So changing NOTHING in the current structure of SVN .</p>

<p>And I just can't handle how to do this with the IntelliJ structure (projects, modules, ... ) .</p>

<p>In addition there appears to have a problem with Android Studio, it is impossible for me to IMPORT module , I can create one, but not import one...</p>

<p>And that's not all , in ""Open Module settings"" , only Android SDK Appears for EACH project. So I can not handle modules ...</p>

<p>I tried to import each project one by one with a checkout from Subversion, it works, but how to link projects to each other then ? I end up with a project structure as in eclipse, and I guess that is not good.</p>

<p>In Android Studio, a module is dependent on a project (right ?), but I do not want a library dependent of any project.</p>

<p>Please, do not hesitate to ask any information. I'm sure that I didn't say everything, because I try that from 2 days now, so I've try many many things... I just can't get it.</p>

<p>What's wrong ? </p>

"Background-color hex to JavaScript variable","<p>I'm kind of new to JavaScript and jQuery and now I'm facing a problem:</p>

<p>I need to post some data to PHP and one bit of the data needs to be the background color hex of div X.</p>

<p>jQuery has the css(""background-color"") function and with it I can get RGB value of the background into a JavaScript variable.</p>

<p>The CSS function seems to return a string like this rgb(0, 70, 255). </p>

<p>I couldn't find any way to get hex of the background-color (even though it's set as hex in CSS).</p>

<p>So it seems like I need to convert it. I found a function for converting RGB to hex, but it needs to be called with three different variables, r, g and b. So I would need to parse the string rgb(x,xx,xxx) into var r=x; var g=xx; var b=xxx; somehow. </p>

<p>I tried to google parsing strings with JavaScript, but I didn't really understand the regular expressions thing. </p>

"An Overview of Nix/OS Architecture?","<p>While the Nix/OS wiki and manuals provide a lot of excellent information, I am still having trouble getting an architectural overview. Apologies for the quantity and naivity of the questions; feel free to answer a subset:</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>1. What constitutes a Nix package?</strong></p>

<p>From my reading of the manual a Nix package is:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. A Nix expression that fetches the source and dependencies needed to build.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. A <code>builder</code> script.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;iii. A listing on <code>all-packages.nix</code>.</p>

<p>The source and the binary along with generated derivations are put in the <code>nix/store</code>, and channels automate updates, keeping them up to date efficiently by using a shared binary cache.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Is this correct and complete?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Where are the .nix expressions stored?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. May I simply copy a package folders between the <code>nix/store</code>s of different machines if they have the same architecture?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>2. What constitutes a Nix environment?</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Where and how are environments defined?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. What about user profiles?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. How does the <code>nix-shell</code> command work? Is it related to the <code>nix-env</code> command?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>3. What is the relationship between NixOS's <code>configuration.nix</code> and Nix environments?</strong></p>

<p>From the manual and wiki I gather NixOS is a Nix package, and that Nix creates a basic system environment based on <code>configuration.nix</code>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Is this true, and if so what do <code>nixos-rebuild</code> and <code>nixos-install</code> do besides this?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Is it possible to reverse the process, i.e. generate succinct package or configuration files from an environment?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. What can I do with NixOS that I cannot do with Nix?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>4. What are best practices when using Nix for creating portable and reproducible environments to share with colleagues?</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. What are the various approaches to sharing desktop, server and development environments?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. What are the use-cases for these approaches?</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. What are their advantages and disadvantages vis-à-vis portability and accesibility?</p>

I actually discovered I could remove a join from that query, so now the working query is</p>

<pre><code>start_cards = DeckCard.find :all, :joins =&gt; [:card], :conditions =&gt; [""deck_cards.deck_id = ? and cards.start_card = ?"", @game.deck.id, true]  
</code></pre>

<p>This appears to work. However, when I try to move these DeckCards into another association, I get the ActiveRecord::ReadOnlyRecord error.</p>

<p>Here's the code</p>

<pre><code>for player in @game.players 
  player.tableau = Tableau.new
  start_card = start_cards.pop 
  start_card.draw_pile = false
  player.tableau.deck_cards &lt;&lt; start_card  # the error occurs on this line
end
</code></pre>

<p>and the relevant Models (tableau are the players cards on the table)</p>

<pre><code>class Player &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :game
  belongs_to :user
  has_one :hand
  has_one :tableau
end

class Tableau &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :player
  has_many :deck_cards
end  

class DeckCard &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :card
  belongs_to :deck  
end
</code></pre>

<p>I am doing a similar action just after this code, adding <code>DeckCards</code> to the players hand, and that code is working fine. I wondered if I needed <code>belongs_to :tableau</code> in the DeckCard Model, but it works fine for the adding to player's hand. I do have a <code>tableau_id</code> and <code>hand_id</code> columns in the DeckCard table.</p>

"Using VBA to insert and keep images in file - Excel 2013","<p>I'm working on a macro for a friend of mine who needs to import a set of images in an excel document and later use this document on other computers. The problem I encountered is that when opening this document on a different computer, all the images are gone and instead you get these little error signs, indicating that the image path could not be found.</p>

<p>I have developed the macro on my own computer where I have Excel 2007 and for me, the code works perfectly fine. My friend uses Excel 2013 and apparently, there seems to be a major difference on how those 2 versions deal with the image importing and saving.</p>

<p>Overall, I found 2 different ways how to insert images. The first one I tried was something similar to this:</p>

<pre><code>Set pic = ActiveSheet.Pictures.Insert(""C:\documents\somepicture.jpg"")
</code></pre>

<p>The second way of doing this looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>Set pic = Application.ActiveSheet.Shapes.AddPicture(""C:\documents\somepicture.jpg"", False, True, 1, 1, 1, 1)
</code></pre>

<p>In the documentation for this 2nd approach it is said that the 3rd paramenter (which is True here) is responsible for saving the picture with the document.</p>

<p>However, both these approaches look more or less the same in the end result: They work fine for me but won't work if they are executed on my friends pc with Excel 2013. So what I need is a work-around for the newer Excel versions (I read somewhere that from Excel 2010 upwards, there is a bug or something like that with these image import methods).</p>

<pre><code>    [System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapDocumentMethodAttribute(""http://blahblah.com/webservices/AddressSearch"", RequestNamespace = ""http://blahblah.com/webservices/"", ResponseNamespace = ""http://blahblah.com/webservices/"", Use = System.Web.Services.Description.SoapBindingUse.Literal, ParameterStyle = System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapParameterStyle.Wrapped)]
    [blahblah.TriadLite.Core.AuditSoapCapture]
    public System.Data.DataSet AddressSearch(string HouseNumber, string StreetName, string ZipCode) {
        object[] results = this.Invoke(""AddressSearch"", new object[] {
                    HouseNumber,
                    StreetName,
                    ZipCode});
        return ((System.Data.DataSet)(results[0]));
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I am looking for a way to add this attribute to specific methods without modifying the generated client proxy, as they will get lost when we regenerate.  Can I do this in a another partial class or interface or some other way?</p>

"Are Google Chrome and Chromium equivalent for web design/development?","<p>This is probably a silly question, however: from a Web Design/Development point of view (I mean support for web standards and web technologies), could Google Chrome and Chromium be considered equivalent?</p>

<p>I know that they are essentially the same browser, the former being the branded version of the latter, but they also have some functional differences, and Google Chrome features some additions not present in the base Chromium browser (detailed on the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)#Differences_from_Google_Chrome"" rel=""noreferrer"">Chromium page</a> on Wikipedia).</p>

<p>They use the Blink engine, which is in turn also used by other Chromium-based browsers like MS Edge and Opera; and all these browsers have an uneven support for many different web technologies, as detailed on <a href=""https://caniuse.com"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://caniuse.com</a>.</p>

<p>I'm working on a Linux machine, and my distro ships Chromium by default, providing it from its standard repo; for the sake of simplicity and keeping things clean, I would prefer to avoid adding another external repo and install Chrome just for this task, if I can rely Chromium to behave exactly the same and not have any compatibility issue.</p>

<p>Like I said, this question is probably silly, but given the differences between other Chromium-based browsers, maybe this doubt of mine could be justified. </p>

<p>EDIT: Please note that I'm not interested in the differences between Google Chrome and Chromium from an user point of view or in details of their history and so on; I only wish to know if from a website development point of view, they are fully compatible or if they support the same set of features. <strong>In other words, if I test a site from Chromium, can I be sure that it will work also in Google Chrome?

<p><em><strong>EDIT 2:</strong></em> I must be talking to the wrong people, I was really hoping for somebody to argue with :-)</p>
<hr />
<p>So I would guess, being in the minority, that I'm wrong, but I can't understand why this debate has any merit. I see null as a bug-finding tool. Consider the following:</p>
<pre><code>class Class { ... }

void main() {
    Class c = nullptr;
    // ... ... ... code ...
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; c.count; ++i) { ... }

    // ... ... ... code ...
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; c.count; ++i) { ... }

<p>Whoops. The loop gets silently skipped. It could take a while to track down the problem.</p>

"Disable antialiasing for a specific GDI device context","<p>I'm using a third party library to render an image to a GDI DC and I need to ensure that any text is rendered without any smoothing/antialiasing so that I can convert the image to a predefined palette with indexed colors.</p>

<p>The third party library i'm using for rendering doesn't support this and just renders text as per the current windows settings for font rendering. They've also said that it's unlikely they'll add the ability to switch anti-aliasing off any time soon.</p>

<p>The best work around I've found so far is to call the third party library in this way (error handling and prior settings checks ommitted for brevity):</p>

<pre><code>private static void SetFontSmoothing(bool enabled)
{
    int pv = 0;
    SystemParametersInfo(Spi.SetFontSmoothing, enabled ? 1 : 0, ref pv, Spif.None);
}

// snip
Graphics graphics = Graphics.FromImage(bitmap)
IntPtr deviceContext = graphics.GetHdc();

SetFontSmoothing(false);
thirdPartyComponent.Render(deviceContext);
SetFontSmoothing(true);
</code></pre>

<p>This obviously has a horrible effect on the operating system, other applications flicker from cleartype enabled to disabled and back every time I render the image.</p>

<p>So the question is, does anyone know how I can alter the font rendering settings for a specific DC?</p>

<p>Even if I could just make the changes process or thread specific instead of affecting the whole operating system, that would be a big step forward! (That would give me the option of farming this rendering out to a separate process- the results are written to disk after rendering anyway)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I'd like to add that I don't mind if the solution is more complex than just a few API calls. I'd even be happy with a solution that involved hooking system dlls if it was only about a days work.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: Background Information</strong>
The third-party library renders using a palette of about 70 colors. After the image (which is actually a map tile) is rendered to the DC, I convert each pixel from it's 32-bit color back to it's palette index and store the result as an 8bpp greyscale image. This is uploaded to the video card as a texture. During rendering, I re-apply the palette (also stored as a texture) with a pixel shader executing on the video card. This allows me to switch and fade between different palettes instantaneously instead of needing to regenerate all the required tiles. It takes between 10-60 seconds to generate and upload all the tiles for a typical view of the world.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: Renamed GraphicsDevice to Graphics</strong>
The class GraphicsDevice in the previous version of this question is actually System.Drawing.Graphics. I had renamed it (using GraphicsDevice = ...) because the code in question is in the namespace MyCompany.Graphics and the compiler wasn't able resolve it properly.</p>

<p>For each difference I create an object of type ObjectDifference and add it to the array. The highlighted portion is the one where I am stuck! If the object contains another complex object, My program does give me the differences but I dont know which type it belonged to</p>

<p>For example, I have two objects of type Name</p>

<pre><code>class Name
{
  string firstName, LastName;
  List phNumber;
}

class PhoneNumber
{
  string officeNo, MobileNo, HomeNo;
}
</code></pre>

<p>while comparing two objects the output I get is plain -</p>

<ul>
<li><code>firstname</code> - John Mary </li>
<li><code>LastName</code> - cooper Lor</li>
<li><code>officeNo</code> - 22222 44444 </li>
<li><code>MobileNo</code> - 989898 089089 </li>
<li><code>HomeNo</code> - 4242 43535</li>
</ul>

<p>The Hierarchy that <code>officeNo</code> is of type <code>PhoneNumber</code> is lost, which is important for me to display.</p>

<p>How should I maintain this type of tree while creating differences? Hope I am able to make my problem understood. </p>

"How can I make sure N threads run at roughly the same speed?","<p>I'm toying with the idea of writing a physics simulation software in which each physical element would be simulated in its own thread.</p>

<p>There would be several advantages to this approach. It would be conceptually very close to how the real world works. It would be much easier to scale the system to multiple machines.</p>

<p>However, for this to work I need to make sure that all threads run at the same speed, with a rather liberal interpretation of 'same'. Say within 1% of each others.</p>

<p>That's why I don't necessarily need a Thread.join() like solution. I don't want some uber-controlling school mistress that ensures all threads regularly synchronize with each others. I just need to be able to ask the runtime (whichever it is---could be Java, Erlang, or whatever is most appropriate for this problem) to run the threads at a more or less equal speed.</p>

<p>Any suggestions would be extremely appreciated.</p>

"Effective ways of finding an element in a Javascript array","<p>I am using an array with titles. Each titles index corresponds to an id in a database which contains html for that given title.</p>

<p>Lets say I have a string which contains one of the titles.</p>

<pre><code>title = ""why-birds-fly"";
titles[] // an array which contains all the titles
</code></pre>

<p>To use the string ""title"" to get the corresponding id I could do:</p>

<pre><code>for (i = 0; i &lt; titles.length-1; i++) {
  if (titles[i] == title)
    return i+1;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Another method I could use is to create an associative array together with the titles array which is the exact opposite of titles. That is, it uses the string as an index and returns the number.</p>

<pre><code>titles_id {blah:0,why-birds-fly:1,blah2:2}
</code></pre>

<p>I could then access the ID by:</p>

<pre><code>return titles_id[title]+1;

<p>What would be most effective considering CPU, Memory, etc?</p>

"How to deny shutdown when pressing the power button for a while?","<p>On most newer computers you can shutdown the hard way by pressing the power button for a couple of seconds. But I want to prevent this completely.</p>

<p>You're able to prevent some soft events like the sleep, suspend, hibernate and ""Press power button"" events in Windows control panel; you can also use some Win32 and WDI programming to catch and handle/deny those events but it doesn't seem to stop the <em>mechanical power off</em> when you hold the button for a longer time.</p>

"Jeditable with jQuery UI Datepicker","<p>I need to have a click to edit element on a page, that will in turn invoke an instance of the jQuery UI Datepicker. </p>

<p>Currently, I'm using JEditable to provide the in place editing, which is working fine. However, I have a date control input that I would like to have appear as a calendar, which is where the fun starts.</p>

<p>I've found a Comment in the this <a href=""http://www.appelsiini.net/2008/2/creating-inline-timepicker-with-javascript"" rel=""noreferrer"">blog</a> by Calle Kabo (the page is a little mashed unfortunately) that details a way to do this:</p>

<pre><code>$.editable.addInputType(""datepicker"", {
        element:  function(settings, original) {
            var input = $(""&lt;input type=\""text\"" name=\""value\"" /&gt;"");
            $(this).append(input);
            return(input);
        },
        plugin:  function(settings, original) {
            var form = this;
            $(""input"", this).filter("":text"").datepicker({

            });
        }
    });
</code></pre>

<p>However, I can't get the above to work - no errors, but no effect either. I've tried placing it within the jQuery document ready function and also outside of it - no joy.</p>

<p>My UI Datepicker class is date-picker and my Jeditable class is ajaxedit, I'm sure the above inaction is due to the need to reference them somehow in the code, but I don't know how. Also, the Jeditable control is one of many element ids, if that has a bearing.</p>

"How can I retrieve a JDBC ResultSet as an ArrayList?","<p>I'm doing a query to retrieve a large amount of IDs (integers). Instead of iterating millions of times through the ResultSet and copying everything one-by-one to an ArrayList, is there some way to simply retrieve everything as an ArrayList?</p>

<p>I understand that ResultSet is supposed to be iterated because the underlying implementation may be caching stuff, but in my situation I just need all the IDs straight away. I know I can set the FetchSize to a large number, but then I still have to retrieve the IDs one-by-one.</p>

<p>Clarification: the reason I want to do this is performance. Profiling shows me that doing ResultSet.next(), ResultSet.getInt() and ArrayList.add() millions of times takes quite some time. I figure that the database (I'm using H2, which is written in Java) probably has the array or list somewhere in memory, so I'm looking for a way to have it copied to me directly instead of through the ResultSet iterating interface.</p>

  <p>A Python function or method to integrate. If <code>func</code> takes many
  arguments, it is integrated along the axis corresponding to the first
  argument.</p>
  
  <p>If the user desires improved integration performance, then <code>f</code> may be a
  <code>scipy.LowLevelCallable</code> with one of the signatures:</p>

<pre><code>double func(double x)
double func(double x, void *user_data) 
double func(int n, double *xx) 
double func(int n, double *xx, void *user_data) 
</code></pre>
  
  <p>The user_data is the data contained in the <code>scipy.LowLevelCallable</code>. In the
  call forms with <code>xx</code>, <code>n</code> is the length of
  the <code>xx</code> array which contains <code>xx[0] == x</code> and the rest of the items are
  numbers contained in the args argument of quad.</p>
  
  <p>In addition, certain ctypes call signatures are supported for backward
  compatibility, but those should not be used in new code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I need to use the <code>scipy.LowLevelCallable</code> objects for speeding up my code, and I need to stick my function design to one of the above signatures. Moreover, since I do not want to be complicating the whole thing with C libraries and compilers, I want to solve this ""on the fly"" with the tools available from <code>numba</code>, in particular <code>numba.cfunc</code>, which allows me to by-pass the Python C API.</p>

<p>I have been able to solve this for an integrand that takes as an input the integration variable and an arbitrary number of scalar parameters:</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>    from scipy import integrate, LowLevelCallable
    from numba import njit, cfunc
    from numba.types import intc, float64, CPointer

        jitted_function = njit(integrand_function)

        @cfunc(float64(intc, CPointer(float64)))
        def wrapped(n, xx):
            return jitted_function(xx[0], xx[1], xx[2], xx[3])
        return LowLevelCallable(wrapped.ctypes)

    @jit_integrand_function
    def regular_function(x1, x2, x3, x4):
        return x1 + x2 + x3 + x4

    def do_integrate_wo_arrays(a, b, c, lolim=0, hilim=1):
        return integrate.quad(regular_function, lolim, hilim, (a, b, c))

    &gt;&gt;&gt; print(do_integrate_wo_arrays(1,2,3,lolim=2, hilim=10))
    (96.0, 1.0658141036401503e-12)
</code></pre>

<p>This code works just fine. I am able to jit the integrand function and return the jitted function as a <code>LowLevelCallable</code> object. However, I actually need to pass to my integrand two <code>numpy.array</code>s, and the above construction breaks:</p>

<p>Well now, obviously this doesn't work, because in this example I have not modified the design of the decorator. But that is exactly the core of my question: I do not fully understand this situation and therefore don't know how to modify the <code>cfunc</code> arguments for passing an array as parameter and still complying with the <code>scipy.integrate.quad</code> signature requirements. In the <code>numba</code> documentation that introduces <code>CPointers</code> there is an example of how to pass an array to a <code>numba.cfunc</code>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Native platform ABIs as used by C or C++ don’t have the notion of a
  shaped array as in Numpy. One common solution is to pass a raw data
  pointer and one or several size arguments (depending on
  dimensionality). Numba must provide a way to rebuild an array view of
  this data inside the callback.</p>
  
  <pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>    from numba import cfunc, carray
    from numba.types import float64, CPointer, void, intp

    # A callback with the C signature `void(double *, double *, size_t)`

    @cfunc(void(CPointer(float64), CPointer(float64), intp))
    def invert(in_ptr, out_ptr, n):
        in_ = carray(in_ptr, (n,))
        out = carray(out_ptr, (n,))
        for i in range(n):
            out[i] = 1 / in_[i] ```
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>I somehow understand that the <code>CPointer</code> is used for building the array in C, as in the signature of my decorator example <code>CPointer(float64)</code> gathers all the floats passed as arguments and puts them into an array. However, I am still not able to put it together and see how I can use it for passing an array, not for making an array out of the collection of <code>float</code> arguments I pass.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>The answer by <code>@max9111</code> worked, in the sense that was able to pass to the <code>scipy.integrate.quad</code> a <code>LowLevelCallable</code> that improved the time efficiency of the calculation. This is very valuable, as now it is much clearer how management of memory addresses work in C. Even though the concept of structured array does not exist in native C, I can create a structured array in Python with data that C is going to store in a contiguous memory region and access it/point to it through a unique memory address. The mapping provided by the structured array allows for identifying the different components of that memory region.</p>

<p>Even though the solution by <code>@max9111</code> works and solves the question I posted originally, from the Python perspective this approach introduces a certain overhead that, under certain conditions, might be more time consuming than the time gained by now calling the <code>scipy.integrate.quad</code> integration function via a <code>LowLevelCallable</code>. </p>

<p>In my real case I am using the integration as a step of a two-dimensional optimization problem. Each step of the optimization requires to integrate twice, and the integral requires nine scalar parameters ad two arrays. As long as I have not been able to solve the integration via a <code>LowLevelCallable</code>, the only thing I could do to speed up the code was to simply <code>njit</code> the integrand function. And that worked decently even though the integration was still being fired via the Python API.</p>

<p>In my case, implementing <code>@max9111</code>'s solution has greatly improved the efficiency in the integration time (from about 0.0009s per step to about 0.0005 ). Nevertheless, the step of creating the structured array, C-unpacking the data, pass it to the jitted integrand and return a <code>LowLevelCallable</code> has added an extra 0.3s on average per iteration, thereby worsening my situation.</p>

<p>Here there is some toy code for showing how the <code>LowLevelCallable</code> approach becomes the worse option the more one goes for an iterative process:</p>

<p>Here the two options (only jitting the integrand vs. <code>@max9111</code>'s solution) are compared. In a modified version of <code>@max9111</code>'s solution, I have permanently jitted the integrand function (<code>function_using_arrays</code>) and removed that step from <code>create_jit_integrand_function</code>, which reduces the ""overhead"" time by a neat 20%. Moreover, also for the sake of speed, I have suppressed the <code>jit_with_dummy_data</code> function and included its functionality in the body of <code>process_lowlev_callable</code>, basically for avoiding an unnecessary function call. Find in the following the calculation time for both solutions for a series of up to 100 cycles:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kgvxn.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Kgvxn.png"" alt=""Calculation time ellapsed for only jitting the integrand vs building a LowLevelCallable""></a> </p>

<p>As you can see, if you are in an iterative process, the time saved in each single calculation (30+ %!!) does not pay off the overhead carried by the couple extra functions that you need to implement for building the LowLevelCallable (functions that are as well called iteratively and run over the Python C API).</p>

<p>Bottom line: this solution is very good for reducing calculation time in one single very heavy integral, but just jitting the integrand seems to be better off when solving average integrals within an iterative process, since the extra functions required by the LowlevelCallable, that need to be called as much often as the integration itself, take their toll.</p>

<p>Anyway, thank you very much. Even though this solution will not work for me, I learned valuable things and I consider my question solved.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong></p>

<p>I misunderstood parts of <code>@max9111</code>'s solution and the role played by the function <code>create_jit_integrand_function</code>, and I was wrongly compiling the <code>LowLevelCallable</code> in each step of my optimization (which I do not need to do beacuse, even though the parameters and arrays passed to the integral change each iteration, their shape, and therefore that of the C struct remains constant).</p>

<p>The refactored version of the code from the above <strong>EDIT</strong> that makes sense:</p>

"Mocking a singleton with mockito","<p>I need to test some legacy code, which uses a singleton in a a method call. The purpose of the test is to ensure that the clas sunder test makes a call to singletons method. 
I have seen similar questions on SO, but all the answers require other dependencies (different test frameworks) - I'm unfortunately limited to using Mockito and JUnit, but this should be perfectly possible with such popular framework.</p>

<p>The singleton:</p>

<pre><code>public class FormatterService {

    private static FormatterService INSTANCE;

    private FormatterService() {
    }

    public static FormatterService getInstance() {
        if (INSTANCE == null) {
            INSTANCE = new FormatterService();
        }
        return INSTANCE;
    }

    public String formatTachoIcon() {
        return ""URL"";
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>The class under test:</p>

<pre><code>public class DriverSnapshotHandler {

    public String getImageURL() {
        return FormatterService.getInstance().formatTachoIcon();
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>The unit test:</p>

<pre><code>public class TestDriverSnapshotHandler {

    private FormatterService formatter;

    @Before
    public void setUp() {

        formatter = mock(FormatterService.class);

        when(FormatterService.getInstance()).thenReturn(formatter);

        when(formatter.formatTachoIcon()).thenReturn(""MockedURL"");

    }

    @Test
    public void testFormatterServiceIsCalled() {

        DriverSnapshotHandler handler = new DriverSnapshotHandler();
        handler.getImageURL();

        verify(formatter, atLeastOnce()).formatTachoIcon();

    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>The idea was to configure the expected behaviour of the dreaded singleton, since the class under test will call it's getInstance and then formatTachoIcon methods. Unfortunately this fails with an error message:</p>

<pre><code>when() requires an argument which has to be 'a method call on a mock'.

"Angular 2 TestBed with mocks","<p>I am trying to test a component which uses another service. And I want to isolate the component by providing a mock for the service. Before RC5 I can simply use <code>addproviders</code> which is now deprecated and will be removed by the next RC. Instead I have to use the <code>TestBed</code>. When I provide the mock angular for some reason keep looking for the services that the mock depends on. And throws a <code>DI exception</code>. When I provide all the dependencies the test works but I don't want to repeat myself for each test suite. And this breaks basic OO principles.

"bootstrap 3 navbar dropdown box color","<p>I am using flat UI theme with bootstrap 3.  The flat UI theme navbar is not working correctly and many are having similar issues with it that have posted on github.  So I decided to just use the default BS3 navbar and write my own code (with the help of another stackoverflow thread) to style the menu the way I would like. I am doing this in LESS as an override css.</p>

<p>The problem is I can't figure out how to change the following.</p>

<ul>
<li>drop down box color</li>
<li>the drop down box link color</li>
<li>drop down box link hover color</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the css I am using:</p>

<pre><code>/* navbar */
.navbar-default {
   font-size: floor(@component-font-size-base * 1.067); // ~16px
   border-radius: @border-radius-large;
   border: none;
   background-color: @brand-primary !important;
}
/* title */
.navbar-default .navbar-brand {
    color: #5E5E5E;
}
/* link */
.navbar-default .navbar-nav &gt; li &gt; a {
    color: @clouds;
}
.navbar-default .navbar-nav &gt; li &gt; a:hover {
    color: @clouds;
}
.navbar-default .navbar-nav &gt; .active &gt; a, 
.navbar-default .navbar-nav &gt; .active &gt; a:hover, 
.navbar-default .navbar-nav &gt; .active &gt; a:focus {
    color: @clouds;
    background-color: @brand-secondary;  // Changes color of main button that is currently active.
}
.navbar-default .navbar-nav &gt; .open &gt; a, 
.navbar-default .navbar-nav &gt; .open &gt; a:hover, 
.navbar-default .navbar-nav &gt; .open &gt; a:focus {
    color: @clouds;
    background-color: @brand-secondary;  //  Changes color of main menu button once clicked.
}
/* caret */

<p>This produces the correct color bar, bar link, carets, and bar hover effects.  But when I click a button with a sub menu, the sub menu still appears in the default BS gray.  What classes am I missing to change the drop down sub menu background color, link color, etc?</p>

"Is there a method to swap the left and right hand sides of a set of expressions in Visual Studio?","<p>I have a decent sized set of data that needs to be stored in an active record. In order to prepopulate the form fields on the page, I have already written the following code:</p>

<pre><code>Device device = new Device(DeviceID); // device is simply the active record

txtDeviceName.Text = device.Name;
txtNotes.Text = device.Notes;
txtHostName.Text = device.Hostname;
txtAssetTag.Text = device.AssetTag;
txtSerialNumber.Text = device.SerialNumber;
// snip... the list goes on!
</code></pre>

<p>Is there some sort of the method (built-in functionality, macro, etc.) that I could use to swap each side of the expression such that the data is saved into the active record as opposed to read from it in order to perform a database insert? For example, after highlighting the above code and running the macro, it would become:</p>

<pre><code>device.DeviceName = txtDeviceName.Text;
device.Notes = txtNotes.Text;
device.Hostname = txtHostName.Text;
device.AssetTag = txtAssetTag.Text;
device.SerialNumber = txtSerialNumber.Text;
// snip again...
</code></pre>

<p>Since the number of columns in the database that this active record encapsulates is rather large, it seems like most of this typing could be avoided with a simple automated process.</p>

<p>Obviously this wouldn't work 100% because sometimes there would have to be type conversions (e.g. <code>int</code> to <code>string</code>) but for the most part I think this would save a lot of time.</p>

(e.g. <a href=""https://agner.org/optimize/"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://agner.org/optimize/</a>)</p>

<p>But are there independent dividers for FP and integer (competing only for dispatch via port 0), or <strong>does interleaving two div-throughput-bound workloads make their cost add nearly linearly, if one is integer and the other is FP?</strong></p>

<p>This is complicated by Intel CPUs (unlike AMD) decoding integer division to multiple uops, e.g. 10 for <code>div r32</code> on Skylake.</p>

<hr>

<p>AMD CPUs similarly have their divider on one execution port, but I don't know as much about them and don't have one to test on.  AMD integer division decodes to only a couple uops (to write RDX and RAX), not microcoded.  Experiments on AMD might be easier to interpret without lots of uops flying around being a possible cause for contention between int and fp div.</p>

<p><strong>How I think I can solve this:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Set the session.gc_maxlifetime to 1 hour (3600)</li>
<li>Set the session.gc_probability to 1 </li>
<li>Set the session.gc_divisor to 1</li>
<li>Therefore having a 100% certainty that garbage collection will occur on any idle session cookies after 1 hour.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>My question:</strong></p>

<p>All the posts and documentation I've read has never mentioned setting a gc change of 100%, therefore is it bad to do this? Is there a better way? </p>

<p>It's a symfony app, and long term I would like to do something like this <a href=""http://symfony.com/doc/master/components/http_foundation/session_configuration.html#session-meta-data"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://symfony.com/doc/master/components/http_foundation/session_configuration.html#session-meta-data</a> but for now I was hoping to just do something simple with session.gc_*</p>

<p>One post I read implies that having a 100% garbage collection chance is ""cost-intensive"" <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/520237/how-do-i-expire-a-php-session-after-30-minutes/1270960#1270960"">How do I expire a PHP session after 30 minutes?</a> is this true?

"Turn image sequence into video with transparency","<p>I've got what seems like it should be a really simple problem, but it's proving much harder than I expected.  Here's the issue:</p>

<p>I've got a fairly large image sequence consisting of numbered frames (output from Maya, for what its worth).  The images are currently in Targa (.tga) format, but I could convert them to PNGs or other arbitrary format if that matters.  The important thing is, they've got an alpha channel.</p>

<p>What I want to do is programatically turn them into a video clip.  The format doesn't really matter, but it needs to be lossless and have an alpha channel.  Uncompressed video in a Quicktime container would probably be ideal.</p>

<p>My initial thought was ffmpeg, but after wasting most of a day on it it seems it's got no support at all for alpha channels.  Either I'm missing something, or the underlying libavcodec just doesn't do it.</p>

<p>So, what's the right way here?  A command line tool like ffmpeg would be nice, but any solution that runs on Windows and could be called from a script would be fine.</p>

<p>Note:  Having an alpha chanel in your video isn't actually all that uncommon, and it's really useful if you want to composite it on top of another video clip or a still image.  As far as I know uncompressed video, the Quicktime Animation codec, and the Sorenson Video 3 codec all support tranparency, and I've heard H.264 does as well.  All we're really talking about is 32-bit color depth, and that's pretty widely supported; both Quicktime .mov files and Windowss .avi files can handle it, and probably a lot more too.</p>

<p>Quicktime Pro is more than happy to turn an image sequence into a 32-bit .mov file.  Hit export, change color depth to ""Millions of Colors+"", select the Animation codec, crank the quality up to 100, and there you are - losslessly compressed video, with an alpha chanel, and it'll play back almost anywhere since the codec has been part of Quicktime since version 1.0.  The problem is, Quicktime Pro doesn't have any sort of command-line interface (at least on Windows).  ffmpeg supports encoding using the Quicktime Animation codec (which it calls qtrle), but it only supports a bit-depth of 24 bits.</p>

<p>The issue isn't finding a video format that supports an alpha channel.  Quicktime Animation would be ideal, but even uncompressed video should work.  The problem is finding a tool that supports it.</p>

"How to get a file name from a file's byte array?","<p>I have the bytes representing a file that I am transmitting over a network. Besides reconstructing the file manually on the file system, how can I get the information from the File, such as getName(), getPath(), etc?</p>

<p>In other words:</p>

<ol>
<li>I start out with a File on machine A</li>
<li>I use FileUtils to turn the file into a byte array</li>
<li>I transmit that file over a network to machine B</li>
<li>On machine B, I want to reconstruct that byte[] into a File and run methods such as getName()</li>

<li>(File) bytes --> Does not convert</li>
<li>((File) ((Object) bytes))) --> Does not convert either</li>

<p>I would really rather not create a new temporary file on the filesytem, although I know there are static File.createTemp available that will do that. I'd prefer to just keep it in memory, construct a new File object from the byte[] array, get the information I Need and be done.</p>

<p>Actually, what would be even better is an API that will take the byte[] and from it, directly get the file name by parsing the bits. </p>

"Why is 'this' a pointer and not a reference?","<p>I was reading the answers to this question <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/385297/whats-wrong-with-c-compared-to-other-languages"">C++ pros and cons</a> and got this doubt while reading the comments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>programmers frequently find it confusing that &quot;this&quot; is a pointer but not a reference. another confusion is why &quot;hello&quot; is not of type std::string but evaluates to a char const* (pointer) (after array to pointer conversion) – Johannes Schaub - litb Dec 22 '08 at 1:56</p>
<p>That only shows that it doesn't use the same conventions as other (later) languages. – le dorfier Dec 22 '08 at 3:35</p>
<p>I'd call the &quot;this&quot; thing a pretty trivial issue though. And oops, thanks for catching a few errors in my examples of undefined behavior. :) Although I don't understand what info about size has to do with anything in the first one. A pointer is simply not allowed to point outside allocated memory – jalf Dec 22 '08 at 4:18</p>
<p>Is this a constant poiner? – yesraaj Dec 22 '08 at 6:35</p>
<p>this can be constant if the method is const int getFoo() const; &lt;- in the scope of getFoo, &quot;this&quot; is constant, and is therefore readonly. This prevents bugs and provides some level of guarantee to the caller that the object won't change. – Doug T. Dec 22 '08 at 16:42</p>
<p>you can't reassign &quot;this&quot;. i.e you cannot do &quot;this = &amp;other;&quot;, because this is an rvalue. but this is of type T*, not of type T const . i.e it's a non-constant pointer. if you are in a const method, then it's a pointer to const. T const . but the pointer itself is nonconst – Johannes Schaub - litb Dec 22 '08 at 17:53</p>
<p>think of &quot;this&quot; like this: #define this (this_ + 0) where the compiler creates &quot;this_&quot; as a pointer to the object and makes &quot;this&quot; a keyword. you can't assign &quot;this&quot; because (this_ + 0) is an rvalue. of course that's not how it is (there is no such macro), but it can help understand it – Johannes Schaub - litb Dec 22 '08 at 17:55</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My question is, why is <code>this</code> a pointer a not a reference? Any particular reason for making it a pointer?</p>
<hr />
<p>Some further arguments why <code>this</code> being a reference would make sense:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider <code>Item 1</code> from <code>More Effective C++ </code>: use references when it is guaranteed that we have a valid object i.e. not a NULL (my interpretation).</li>
<li>Furthermore, references are considered safer than pointers (because we can't screw the memory up with a stray pointer).</li>
<li>Thirdly, the syntax for accessing references (<code>.</code>) is a little bit nicer and shorter than accessing pointers (<code>-&gt;</code> or <code>(*)</code>).</li>

"implementation for product keys","<p>I'm implementing a small application in C, which I would like to sell as shareware for a reasonable price later on. It will start of with a 30-day trial, which I am already quite certain of how to implement it.</p>

<p>The problem I have, though, is that I am not quite sure how to implement the product key verification. What I have in mind is that the customer can sign up on my webpage (after trying the product for a while), pay for the product, and get a product key in the form of aaaaa-bbbbb-ccccc-ddddd-eeeee via e-mail (or maybe available via his profile on my website). No problem so far. He/She then drops the key in the appropriate key fields in my app and <em>boom</em> the app is registered.</p>

<p>From what I could gather so far, people either recommend AES or RSA for this. To be honest, I in another direction in college (not cryptography) and the one cryptography class I took was some time ago. But from what I remember, AES is a symmetric encryption algorithm, which would mean that I would only have one key for encryption and decryption, right? How could I then generate thousands of product keys and still validate them in my app (which by the way won't require internet access....so no checking back with a server)?</p>

<p>So I guess RSA would be the way to go? But doesn't RSA produce pretty long keys (at least longer than the required 25 characters from above)?</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/453030/how-can-i-create-a-product-key-for-my-c-app"">another thread</a> I read that some products won't even use encryption for the product key generation/verification, but instead just employ some checks like ""add the 2. and the 17. character and that should total to x"". </p>

<p>What's the fastest, easiest and most secure way to go here? :-) Code samples would be sugar!</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Sebastian </p>

<p>P.S.: Oh...and please don't tell me how my key can and will be cracked at some point.....I know about that, which is primarily why I don't want to spend a lot of time with this issue, but at the same time not make it too easy for the occasional cracker.</p>

<li>Tap the button ""Set inputview to emptyView"". This will create an
empty UIView and assign it to the inputview property of the

<li>Tap the button ""Set inputview to nil"". This will assign nil to the
inputview property of UITextView. This is done in order to show the
system keyboard.</li>
<li>Tap the button ""Dismiss ViewController"". This will dismiss the view
controller to return to the original view controller.</li>
</ol>

<p>As soon as the ViewController is dismissed, the app crashes immediately. The crash log sometimes, but not always, refers to an unrecognized selector being sent to an object. The object's type is different every time the crash is reproduced.</p>

<p>I did some research on this matter and found <a href=""https://community.bitnami.com/t/gradle-doesnt-work-libnative-platform-so/40686"" rel=""noreferrer"">this forum post</a>, but it didn't give me any leads as to how to fix the issue.</p>

<p>Further research led me to a <a href=""https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/issues/14596"" rel=""noreferrer"">Github issue</a>, which appears to be for NixOS, but I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 CLI. Also, I should mention I'm running Gradle 2.10 as well.</p>

<p>I also tried running <code>gradle -Dorg.gradle.native=false build</code> as well, but the outcome was the same.</p>

<p>Now, as far as what user is calling the script, I believe it is www-data as I'm running an Apache2 web server and PHP. </p>

<p>Here's a little snippet of the PHP code that runs the script, which I found on another <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/20109859/2844992"">SO post</a>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
    $command = ""sh /home/andrew/scripts/build.sh 2&gt;&amp;1"";
    while (@ ob_end_flush()); // end all output buffers if any
    $proc = popen($command, 'r');
    echo '&lt;pre style=""border-radius: 5px; padding:4px; color:black; background:#ffffff"" align=""left""&gt;';
    while (!feof($proc)){
        echo fread($proc, 1024);
        @ flush();
    }
    echo '&lt;/pre&gt;';

The tests run all fine, and everything works very well. The one thing I couldn't do so far is to verify the content of the POST requests.</p>

<p>Why do I want to do that?<br/>
The REST Api I'm developing against has some methods, that require the data objects to be sent in the POST requests body, other methods require the objects to be sent as a <code>FormUrlEncoded</code> data field. So I want to ensure, that the <code>Retrofit</code> interface was set up correctly acc. to the spec.</p>

<p>The following unit test will pass, but the first one sends the data incorrectly inside the body:</p>

@POST(""api/v1/user/senddata"")

"Can a proxy server cache SSL GETs? If not, would response body encryption suffice?","<p>Can a (||any) proxy server cache content that is requested by a client over https? As the proxy server can't see the querystring, or the http headers, I reckon they can't.</p>

<p>I'm considering a desktop application, run by a number of people behind their companies proxy. This application may access services across the internet and I'd like to take advantage of the in-built internet caching infrastructure for 'reads'. If the caching proxy servers can't cache SSL delivered content, would simply encrypting the content of a response be a viable option?</p>

<p>I am considering all GET requests that we wish to be cachable be requested over http with the body encrypted using asymmetric encryption, where each client has the decryption key. Anytime we wish to perform a GET that is not cachable, or a POST operation, it will be performed over SSL.</p>

<ol>
<li>Find the longest shipper for each leg</li>
<li>Eliminate the most ""expensive"" one</li>
<li>Find the cheapest shipper for each leg</li>
<li>Calculate the total cost &amp; days</li>
<li>If days are acceptable, finish, else, goto 1</li>

<p>The requirements (as always) have been constantly changing. If I were given the current constraints at the time I began working on this problem, I would be using some variant of the A* algorithm (or Dijkstra's or shortest path or simplex or something). But everything has been morphing and changing, and that brings me to where I'm at right now.</p>

<p>So I guess that means I need to forget about all the crap I've done to this point and just go with what I know I should go with, which is a path finding algorithm.</p>

"Parameter Binding: What happens under the hood?","<p>.NET, Java and other high level database API's in various language often provide techniques known as prepared statements and parameter binding as opposed to sending plain text commands to the Database server. What I would like to know is what happens when you execute a statement like this:</p>

<pre><code>SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(""GetMemberByID"");
cmd.CommandType = CommandType.StoredProcedure;
SqlParameter param = new SqlParameter(""@ID"", memberID);
para.DbType = DbType.Integer;
cmd.Parameters.Add(param);
</code></pre>

<p>I know this is a best practice. SQL injection attacks are minimized this way. But what exactly happens under the hood when you execute these statements? Is the end result still a SQL safe string?  If not, what is the end result? And is this enough to prevent SQL injection attacks?</p>

"Can placement new for arrays be used in a portable way?","<p>Is it possible to actually make use of placement new in portable code when using it for arrays?</p>

<p>It appears that the pointer you get back from new[] is not always the same as the address you pass in (5.3.4, note 12 in the standard seems to confirm that this is correct), but I don't see how you can allocate a buffer for the array to go in if this is the case.</p>

<p>The following example shows the problem. Compiled with Visual Studio, this example results in memory corruption:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;new&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

class A
{
    public:

    A() : data(0) {}
    virtual ~A() {}
    int data;
};

int main()
{
    const int NUMELEMENTS=20;

    char *pBuffer = new char[NUMELEMENTS*sizeof(A)];
    A *pA = new(pBuffer) A[NUMELEMENTS];

    // With VC++, pA will be four bytes higher than pBuffer
    printf(""Buffer address: %x, Array address: %x\n"", pBuffer, pA);

    // Debug runtime will assert here due to heap corruption
    delete[] pBuffer;

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Looking at the memory, the compiler seems to be using the first four bytes of the buffer to store a count of the number of items in it. This means that because the buffer is only <code>sizeof(A)*NUMELEMENTS</code> big, the last element in the array is written into unallocated heap.</p>

<p>So the question is can you find out how much additional overhead your implementation wants in order to use placement new[] safely? Ideally, I need a technique that's portable between different compilers. Note that, at least in VC's case, the overhead seems to differ for different classes. For instance, if I remove the virtual destructor in the example, the address returned from new[] is the same as the address I pass in.</p>

"Can you really build a fast word processor with GoF Design Patterns?","<p>The Gang of Four's <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns"" rel=""noreferrer"">Design Patterns</a> uses a word processor as an example for at least a few of their patterns, particularly Composite and Flyweight.</p>

<p>Other than by using C or C++, could you really use those patterns and the object-oriented overhead they entail to write a high-performing fully featured word processor? </p>

<p>I know that Eclipse is written in Java but I haven't used it much so I don't know if it's all that fast or as polished as something like Visual Studio, which has a C++ based text editing system.</p>

<hr>

<p>I only used C++ and Java as examples. The question has more to do with the overhead of having a lot of in-memory objects like you would in an application such as a word processor or even a game. </p>

<p>Design patterns promote abstraction at the expense of parsimony even though they usually point out when you might take some kind of performance hit. Word processors and especially games get the most benefit from being as close to the metal as possible. </p>

"Prototyping with Python code before compiling","<p>I have been mulling over writing a peak-fitting library for a while.

"AG-Grid with Redux","<p>In my job we decided to use <code>AG-Grid</code> in react variant: <a href=""https://www.ag-grid.com/best-react-data-grid/index.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://www.ag-grid.com/best-react-data-grid/index.php</a></p>
<p>Currently, our architecture for <code>React</code> is <code>Redux</code>. From my little knowledge of <code>AG-Grid</code> I can say that it doesn't fit very well to this architecture. <code>AG-Grid</code> keeps it's overall state inside the component. It's cumbersome or even not clever to try to connect it to redux forcefully and completely.</p>
<p>I can live with that but at least I need to watch for the row model changes - meaning fetches of new rows, sorts, filtering (I don't need to watch for cell changes). I have 2 ideas on how to watch for this and connect it to redux.</p>
<p><strong>Option 1 - Use gridOptions.onModelUpdated()</strong></p>
<p>With <code>gridOptions.onModelUpdated()</code> I know when filtering or sort was executed but I can't get to all rows displayed (<a href=""https://www.ag-grid.com/angular-grid-model/"" rel=""noreferrer"">docs</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>State 1: Row Data</p>
<p>API: There is no API to get this data. However it was provided by the application so you should already have it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus I can't dispatch a <code>redux</code> action as I don't have any data to update it with.</p>
<p><strong>Option 2 - datasource.getRows()</strong></p>
<p>I could dispatch actions with new rows. However, I haven't found any <code>onReset/onRowsDeleted/...</code> event, thus I don't know when to clear redux's <code>state.rows</code>. <strong>Update</strong> I can know that previous rows were cleared if argumernt <code>params</code> of <code>datasource.getRows(params)</code> is <code>params.startRow === 0</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong></p>
<p>Maybe I find a way how to use one of the 2 options but my question is:</p>
<p>Are those good ideas to how connect <code>AG-Grid</code> to <code>Redux</code>?</p>

"ASP.NET Custom Controls - Composites","<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Hi All,<br />
OK, further into my adventures with custom controls...</p>
<p>In summary, here is that I have learned of three main &quot;classes&quot; of custom controls. Please feel free to correct me if any of this is wrong!</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>UserControls</strong> - Which inherit from <em>UserControl</em> and are contained within an <em>ASCX</em> file. These are pretty limited in what they can do, but are a quick and light way to get some UI commonality with designer support.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Composite Controls</strong> - These are controls that inherit from <em>WebControl</em> where you add pre-existing controls to the control within the <em>CreateChildControls</em> method. This provides great flexibility, but lack of designer support without additional coding. They are highly portable though since they can be compiled into a DLL.</li>
<li><strong>Custom Rendered Controls</strong> - Similar to Custom Composite Controls, these are added to a Web Control Library project. The rendering of the control is completely controlled by the programmer by overriding the <em>Render</em> method.</li>
</ol>
<h2>My Thoughts..</h2>
<p>OK, so while playing with custom composites, I found the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have little/no control over the HTML output making it difficult to &quot;debug&quot;.</li>
<li>The <em>CreateChildControls</em> (and subsequent methods) can get real busy with <em>Controls.Add(myControl)</em> everywhere.</li>
<li>I found rendering tables (be it for layout or content) to be considerably awkward.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Question(s)..</h2>
<p>So, I admit, I am new to this so I could be way off-base with some of my points noted above..</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you use Composites?</li>
<li>Do you have any neat tricks to control the HTML output?</li>
<li>Do you just say &quot;to hell with it&quot; and go ahead and create a custom rendered control?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Its something I am keen to get really firm in my mind since I know how much <em>good</em> control development can cut overall development time.</strong></p>

<p>Edit: Just to clarify to those who have asked why we don't like MySQL's licensing. We are developing a commercial product which (currently) depends on MySQL as a database back-end.

"Large, Complex Objects as a Web Service Result","<p>Hello again ladies and gents!</p>
<p>OK, following on from my other question on <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6681/aspnet-web-service-results-proxy-classes-and-type-conversion"">ASP.NET Web Service Results, Proxy Classes and Type Conversion</a>. I've come to a part in my project where I need to get my thinking cap on.</p>
<p>Basically, we have a large, complex custom object that needs to be returned from a Web Service and consumed in the client application.</p>
<p>Now, based on the previous discussion, we know this is going to then take the form of the proxy class(es) as the return type. To overcome this, we need to basically copy the properties from one to the other.</p>
<p>In this case, that is something that I would really, really, <em>really!</em> like to avoid!</p>
<p>So, it got me thinking, <strong>how else could we do this?</strong></p>
<p>My current thoughts are to enable the object for complete serialization to XML and then return the XML as a string from the Web Service. We then de-serialize at the client. This will mean a fair bit of attribute decorating, but at least the code at both endpoints will be light, namely by just using the .NET XML Serializer.</p>

"C# Char* to String","<p>I've looked around a lot and can't seem to find a solution to anything similar to what I'm doing. I have two applications, a native C++ app and a managed C# app. The C++ app allocates a pool of bytes that are used in a memory manager. Each object allocated in this memory manager has a header, and each header has a char* that points to a name given to the object. The C# app acts as a viewer for this memory. I use memory mapped files to allow the C# app to read the memory while the C++ app is running. My issue is that I am trying to read the name of the object from the header structure and display it in C# (or just store it in a String, whatever). Using unsafe code I am able to convert the four bytes that make up the <code>char*</code> into an <code>IntPtr</code>, convert that to a <code>void*</code>, and call <code>Marshal.PtrToStringAnsi</code>. This is the code:</p>

<pre><code>IntPtr namePtr = new IntrPtr(BitConverter.ToInt32(bytes, index));
unsafe
{
    void* ptr = namePtr.ToPointer();
    char* cptr = (char*)ptr;
    output = Marshal.PtrToStringAnsi((IntPtr)ptr);
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, <code>bytes</code> is the array read from the memory mapped file that represents all of the pool of bytes created by the native app, and <code>index</code> is the index of the first byte of the name pointer.</p>

<p>I have verified that, on the managed side of things, the address returned by the call to <code>namePtr.ToPointer()</code> is exactly the address of the name pointer in the native app. If this were native code, I would simply cast <code>ptr</code> to a <code>char*</code> and it would be fine, but in managed code I've read I must use the Marshaller to do this.</p>

<p>This code yields varying results. Sometimes <code>cptr</code> is null, sometimes it points to <code>\0</code>, and other times it points to a few Asian characters (which when run through the <code>PtrToStringAnsi</code> method produce seemingly irrelevant characters). I thought it might be a <code>fixed</code> thing, but <code>ToPointer</code> produces a fixed pointer. And sometimes after the cast to a <code>char*</code> the debugger says <code>Unable to evaluate the expression. The pointer is not valid</code> or something like that (it's not easy to repro every varying thing that comes back). And other times I get an access violation when reading the memory, which leads me to the C++ side of things.</p>

<p>On the C++ side, I figured there might be some issues with actually reading the memory because although the memory that stores the pointer is part of the memory mapped file the actual bytes that make up the text are not. So I looked at how to change read/write access to memory (on Windows, mind you) and found the VirtualProtect method in the Windows libraries, which I use to change access to the memory to PAGE_EXECUTE_WRITECOPY, which I figured would give any application that has a pointer to that address will be able to at least read what's there. But that didn't solve the issue either.</p>

<p>To put it shortly:</p>

<p><strong>I have a pointer (in C#) to the first char in a char array (that was allocated in a C++ app) and am trying to read that array of char's into a string in C#.</strong></p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>The source header looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>struct AllocatorHeader
{
// These bytes are reserved, and their purposes may change.
char _reserved[4];

// A pointer to a destructor mapping that is associated with this object.
DestructorMappingBase* _destructor;

// The size of the object this header is for.
unsigned int _size;

char* _name;
};
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>_name</code> field is the one I'm trying to dereference in C#.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>As of now, even using the solutions provided below, I am unable to dereference this char* in managed code. As such, I have simply made a copy of the char* in the pool referenced by the memory mapped file and use a pointer to that. This works, which makes me believe this is a protection-related issue. If I find a way to circumvent this at some point, I will answer my own question. Until then, this will be my workaround. Thanks to all who helped!</p>

<p>Now I am provided with a ton of classes that I assume are packaging the information into xml format, but I am unsure what to do with them. I have read the documentation provided, but it is fuzzy at best. </p>

<p>The classes generated by wsimport are the following:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/c1gM9.png"" alt=""classes generated by wsimport""></p>

<p>According to the documentation, the following Perl Code works for querying the Tivoli's API</p>

<pre><code>use SOAP::Lite;
#arguments: [hostname] [username] [password] [relevance expression]
#hostname only, e.g. ’example.com’ rather than ’http://example.com/webreports’
my $host = $ARGV[0];
my $username = SOAP::Data-&gt;name(’username’ =&gt; $ARGV[1] );
my $password = SOAP::Data-&gt;name(’password’ =&gt; $ARGV[2] );
my $expr = SOAP::Data-&gt;name(’relevanceExpr’ =&gt; $ARGV[3] );
my $service = SOAP::Lite -&gt; uri( ’http://’ . $host . ’/webreports?wsdl’ )
-&gt; proxy( $host );
my $result = $service -&gt; GetRelevanceResult( $expr, $username, $password );
if( $result-&gt;fault ) {
     print ""faultcode: "" . $result-&gt;faultcode . ""\n"";
     print ""faultstring: "" . $result-&gt;faultstring . ""\n"";
}
else {
     foreach my $answer ( $result-&gt;valueof( ""//GetRelevanceResultResponse/a"" ) ) {
           print $answer . ""\n"";
     }

<p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>

<p>This was much simpler than I thought WSDL generation did all the work. Here is how you use those generated classes.</p>

<p>package connect.tivoli;</p>

<pre><code>public class testMain {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String relevanceQuery =""names of bes computers "";
        WebReportsService wr = new WebReportsService();
        RelevancePortType client;
        client = wr.getPort(RelevancePortType.class);
        System.out.println(client.getRelevanceResult(relevanceQuery, ""ad\\username"", ""password""));
    }

"File Access Strategy in a Multi-Threaded Environment (Web App)","<p>I have a file which is an XML representation of some data that is taken from a Web service and cached locally within a Web Application. The idea being is that this data is <em>very</em> static, but just <em>might</em> change. So I have set it up to cache to a file, and stuck a monitor against it to check if it has been deleted. Once deleted, the file will be refreshed from its source and rebuilt.</p>

<p>I am now running in to problems though, because obviously in a multi-threaded environment it falls over as it is trying to access the data when it is still reading/writing the file.</p>

<p>This is confusing me, because I added a object to lock against, and this is always locked during read/write. It was my understanding that attempted access from other threads would be told to ""wait"" until the lock was released?</p>

<p>Just to let you know, I am real new to multi-threaded development, so I am totally willing to accept this is a screw up on my part :)</p>

"Handling autorotation for one view controller in iOS7","<p>I've read many answers on SO but I can't seem to get autorotation working on iOS7.</p>

<p>I only need one view controller to rotate, so I don't want to set rotation settings in my Info.plist.</p>

<p>As I understand Apple's documentation, a single view controller can override global rotations settings (from Info.plist) by simply overriding two methods. Info.plist is set to only allow Portrait, and my view controller implements the following methods:</p>

<pre><code>- (NSUInteger)supportedInterfaceOrientations
{
    NSLog(@""%s"", __PRETTY_FUNCTION__);
    return UIInterfaceOrientationMaskAllButUpsideDown;
}

- (BOOL)shouldAutorotate
{
    NSLog(@""%s"", __PRETTY_FUNCTION__);
    return true;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I'm seeing those NSLog statements upon rotation but nothing rotates.</p>

<p>If I do configure Info.plist with the proper rotation settings, my view will rotate, but not if I try and rely on my view controller.</p>

<p>Not sure if it matters, but the view I'm trying to rotate is from a .xib using auto layout.</p>

<p>Also, my ViewController is being presented modally and is contained in a navigation controller. I've tried just presenting the view controller by itself and that doesn't work. I've also tried <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15004271/prevent-autorotate-for-one-view-controller#answer-15004471"">adding a category to UINavigationController</a> to get it's autorotation directions from it's topViewController.</p>

In my <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> I've added the CSS and JS necessary. I noticed that the jQuery-UI page uses 1.9.1 jQuery and the latest version is 1.10.2. So I'm assuming there is some sort of conflict going on. Twitter bootstrap requires jQuery so that might be causing the error. Or perhaps I am doing something wrong.</p>

"A python web application framework for tight DB/GUI coupling?","<p>I'm a firm believer of the heretic thought of tight coupling between the backend and frontend: I want existing, implied knowledge about a backend to be automatically made use of when generating user interfaces. E.g., if a VARCHAR column has a maximum with of 20 characters, there GUIs should automatically constrain the user from typing more than 20 characters in a related form field.</p>

<p>And I have strong antipathy to ORMs which want to define my database tables, or are based on some hack where every table needs to have extra numeric ID columns because of the ORM.</p>

<p>I've looked a bit into Python database frameworks and I think I can conclude the SQLAlchemy fits best to my mentality.</p>

<p>Now, I need to find a web application framework which fits naturally with SQLAlchemy (or an equivalent) and perhaps even with my appetite for coupling. With ""web application framework"", I mean products/project such as Pyhons, Django, TurboGears, web2py, etc.</p>

<p>E.g., it should ideally be able to:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>automatically select a suitable form widget</strong> for data entering a given column if told to do so; e.g., if the column has a foreign key to a column with 10 different values, widget should display the 10 possible values as a dropdown</li>
<li><strong>auto-generate javascript form validation code</strong> which gives the end-user quick error feedback if a string is entered into a field which is about to end up in an INTEGER column, etc</li>
<li>auto-generate a <strong>calendar widget</strong> for data which will end up in a DATE column</li>
<li><strong>hint NOT NULL constraints</strong> as javascript which complains about empty or whitespace-only data in a related input field</li>
<li>generate javascript validation code which matches relevant (simple) <strong>CHECK-constraints</strong></li>
<li>make it easy to <strong>avoid SQL injection</strong>, by using prepared statements and/or validation of externally derived data</li>
<li>make it easy to <strong>avoid cross site scripting</strong> by automatically escape outgoing strings when appropriate</li>
<li><strong>make use of constraint names</strong> to generate somewhat user friendly error messages in case a constrataint is violated</li>
</ul>

<p>All this should happen dynamically, so table adjustments are automatically reflected on the frontend - probably with a caching mechanism, so that all the model introspection wouldn't kill performance. In other words, I don't want to repeat my model definition in an XML file (or alike) when it has already been carefully been defined in my database.</p>

<p>Does such a framework exist for Python (or for any language, for that matter)? If not: Which of the several Python web application frameworks will be least in the way if I were to add parts of the above features myself?</p>

"Propagation of Oracle Transactions Between C++ and Java","<p>We have an existing C++ application that we are going to gradually replace with a new Java-based system.  Until we have completely reimplemented everything in Java we expect the C++ and Java to have to communicate with each other (RMI, SOAP, messaging, etc - we haven't decided).</p>

<p>Now my manager thinks we'll need the Java and C++ sides to participate in the same Oracle DB transaction.  This is related to, but different from the usual distrbuted transaction problem of having a single process co-ordinate 2 transactional resources, such as a DB and a message queue.</p>

<p>I think propagating a transaction across processes is a terrible idea from a performance and stability point-of-view, but I am still going to be asked for a solution.</p>

<p>We are using Spring on the Java side and their documentation explicitly states they do not provide any help with transaction propagation.</p>

<p>We are not planning on using a traditional Java EE server (for example: IBM Websphere), which may have support for propagation (not that I can find any definitive documentation).</p>

"Caching a generator","<p>A recent similar question (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19500030/isinstancefoo-types-generatortype-or-inspect-isgeneratorfoo/19500538#19500538"">isinstance(foo, types.GeneratorType) or inspect.isgenerator(foo)?</a>) got me curious about how to implement this generically. </p>

<p>It seems like a generally-useful thing to have, actually, to have a generator-type object that will cache the first time through (like <code>itertools.cycle</code>), report StopIteration, and then return items from the cache next time through, but if the object isn't a generator (i.e. a list or dict that inherently supports O(1) lookup), then don't cache, and have the same behaviour, but for the original list.</p>

<p>Possibilities:</p>

<p>1) Modify itertools.cycle. It looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>def cycle(iterable):
    saved = []
    try: 
         saved.append(iterable.next())
         yield saved[-1]
         isiter = True
    except:
         saved = iterable
         isiter = False
    # cycle('ABCD') --&gt; A B C D A B C D A B C D ...
    for element in iterable:
        yield element
        if isiter: 
            saved.append(element)

     # ??? What next?
</code></pre>

<p>If I could restart the generator, that would be perfect - I could send back a StopIteration, and then on the next gen.next(), return entry 0 i.e. `A B C D StopIteration A B C D StopIteration' but it doesn't look like that's actually possible. </p>

<p>Second would be that once StopIteration is hit, then saved has a cache. But it doesn't look like there's any way to get to the internal saved[] field. Maybe a class version of this? </p>

<p>2) Or I could pass in the list directly:</p>

<pre><code>def cycle(iterable, saved=[]):
    saved.clear()
    try: 
         saved.append(iterable.next())
         yield saved[-1]
         isiter = True
    except:
         saved = iterable
         isiter = False
    # cycle('ABCD') --&gt; A B C D A B C D A B C D ...
    for element in iterable:
        yield element
        if isiter: 
            saved.append(element)

mysaved = []
myiter = cycle(someiter, mysaved)
</code></pre>

<p>But that just looks nasty. And in C/++ I could pass in some reference, and change the actual reference to saved to point to iterable - you can't actually do that in python. So this doesn't even work.</p>

<p>Other options? </p>

<p>Edit: More data. The CachingIterable method appears to be too slow to be effective, but it did push me in a direction that might work. It's slightly slower than the naive method (converting to list myself), but appears not to take the hit if it's already iterable.</p>

<p>Some code and data:</p>

<pre><code>def cube_generator(max=100):
    i = 0
    while i &lt; max:
        yield i*i*i
        i += 1

<p>The rows contents are same in both tables.</p>

<p>But official MSDN documentation is very vague regarding what codepage(s) is used to store filenames (filepaths) on FAT-32.</p>

<p>Here it says that <em>OEM code page</em> (CP437 I assume) is used to store filenames: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd317748.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd317748.aspx</a></p>

<p>But here it turns out that there can be different <em>OEM codepages</em> with CP437 being one of them: <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd317752.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd317752.aspx</a></p>

<p>And we all now that utilities like <em>mount</em> support many more different codepages for FAT, more than just OEM codepages set.</p>

<p>So what is the actual cdepage for FAT-32 filenames? It depends on the system codepage at the time when FAT volume was created? Can FAT support true Double Byte Character Set codepages like UTF-16? Or Multi Byte Character Set codepages like UTF-8 is the limit?</p>

<p>And more specific question:

<p>The point I'm getting at is, I'd like to read each line into an array apply the substr to the dates which will always be in the same position then, pass the array into the table, so the data type for the column can be DATE from the get go.</p>

"Calling non-static member function outside of object's lifetime in C++17","<p>Does the following program have undefined behavior in C++17 and later?</p>

<pre><code>struct A {
    void f(int) { /* Assume there is no access to *this here */ }
};

int main() {
    auto a = new A;
    a-&gt;f((a-&gt;~A(), 0));
}
</code></pre>

<p>C++17 guarantees that <code>a-&gt;f</code> is evaluated to the member function of the <code>A</code> object before the call's argument is evaluated. Therefore the indirection from <code>-&gt;</code> is well-defined. But before the function call is entered, the argument is evaluated and ends the lifetime of the <code>A</code> object (see however the edits below). Does the call still have undefined behavior? Is it possible to call a member function of an object outside its lifetime in this way?</p>

<p>The value category of <code>a-&gt;f</code> is prvalue by <a href=""http://www.eel.is/c++draft/expr.ref#6.3.2"" rel=""noreferrer"">[expr.ref]/6.3.2</a> and <a href=""http://www.eel.is/c++draft/basic.life#7"" rel=""noreferrer"">[basic.life]/7</a> does only disallow non-static member function calls on <em>glvalues</em> referring to the after-lifetime object. Does this imply the call is valid? (Edit: As discussed in the comments I am likely misunderstanding [basic.life]/7 and it probably does apply here.)</p>

<p>Does the answer change if I replace the destructor call <code>a-&gt;~A()</code> with <code>delete a</code> or <code>new(a) A</code> (with <code>#include&lt;new&gt;</code>)?</p>

<hr>

<p>Some elaborating edits and clarifications on my question:</p>

<hr>

<p>If I were to separate the member function call and the destructor/delete/placement-new into two statements, I think the answers are clear:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>a-&gt;A(); a-&gt;f(0)</code>: UB, because of non-static member call on <code>a</code> outside its lifetime. (see edit below, though)</li>
<li><code>delete a; a-&gt;f(0)</code>: same as above</li>
<li><code>new(a) A; a-&gt;f(0)</code>: well-defined, call on the new object</li>
</ol>

<p>However in all these cases <code>a-&gt;f</code> is sequenced after the first respective statement, while this order is reversed in my initial example. My question is whether this reversal does allow for the answers to change?</p>

<hr>

<p>For standards before C++17, I initially thought that all three cases cause undefined behavior, already because the evaluation of <code>a-&gt;f</code> depends on the value of <code>a</code>, but is unsequenced relative to the evaluation of the argument which causes a side-effect on <code>a</code>. However, this is undefined behavior only if there is an actual side-effect on a scalar value, e.g. writing to a scalar object. However, no scalar object is written to because <code>A</code> is trivial and therefore I would also be interested in what constraint exactly is violated in the case of standards before C++17, as well. In particular, the case with placement-new seems unclear to me now.</p>

<hr>

<p>I just realized that the wording about the lifetime of objects changed between C++17 and the current draft. In n4659 (C++17 draft) [basic.life]/1 says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The lifetime of an object o of type T ends when: </p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>if T is a class
  type with a non-trivial destructor (15.4), the destructor call starts</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>while the <a href=""http://www.eel.is/c++draft/basic#life-1.4"" rel=""noreferrer"">current draft</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The lifetime of an object o of type T ends when:</p>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>if T is a class type, the destructor call starts, or</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>[...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, I suppose my example does have well-defined behavior in C++17, but not he current (C++20) draft, because the destructor call is trivial and the lifetime of the <code>A</code> object isn't ended. I would appreciate clarification on that as well. My original question does still stands even for C++17 for the case of replacing the destructor call with delete or placement-new expression.</p>

<hr>

<p>If <code>f</code> accesses <code>*this</code> in its body, then there may be undefined behavior for the cases of destructor call and delete expression, however in this question I want to focus on whether the call in itself is valid or not.
Note however that the variation of my question with placement-new would potentially not have an issue with member access in <code>f</code>, depending on whether the call itself is undefined behavior or not. But in that case there might be a follow-up question especially for the case of placement-new because it is unclear to me, whether <code>this</code> in the function would then always automatically refer to the new object or whether it might need to potentially be <code>std::launder</code>ed (depending on what members <code>A</code> has).</p>

<hr>

<p>While <code>A</code> does have a trivial destructor, the more interesting case is probably where it has some side effect about which the compiler may want to make assumptions for optimization purposes. (I don't know whether any compiler uses something like this.) Therefore, I welcome answers for the case where <code>A</code> has a non-trivial destructor as well, especially if the answer differs between the two cases.</p>

<p>Also, from a practical perspective, a trivial destructor call probably does not affect the generated code and (unlikely?) optimizations based on undefined behavior assumptions aside, all code examples will most likely generate code that runs as expected on most compilers. I am more interested in the theoretical, rather than this practical perspective.</p>

<hr>

<blockquote>
  <p>For presentations which will use a custom presentation controller, 
  it is possible for that presentation controller to also be the 
  transitioningDelegate.  This avoids introducing another object  or
  implementing  in the  source

  declaration.</p>

<p>I've checked the transitioningDelegate on the presented view controller before and after the presentation. Before it is my custom UIPresentationController, but after it is nil. My guess is that the reference is being released, but I cannot find an equivalent to NS_VALID_UNTIL_END_OF_SCOPE in Swift. <strong>EDIT:</strong> I've verified that transitioningDelegate is set up until just before the presentation, and then is nil when it is time to present.</p>

"android textureview full screen preview with correct aspect ratio","<p>I have been working with the <a href=""https://github.com/googlesamples/android-Camera2Video"" rel=""noreferrer"">camera2 api demo from google</a> and unfortunately the sample application is built to display the textureview preview at approximately 70% of the screen height, after looking around I was able to determine that this was being caused by the AutoFitTextureView overriding the <code>onMeasure()</code> method as shown below:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
protected void onMeasure(int widthMeasureSpec, int heightMeasureSpec) {
    super.onMeasure(widthMeasureSpec, heightMeasureSpec);
    int width = MeasureSpec.getSize(widthMeasureSpec);
    int height = MeasureSpec.getSize(heightMeasureSpec);
    if (0 == mRatioWidth || 0 == mRatioHeight) {
        setMeasuredDimension(width, height);
    } else {
        if (width &lt; height * mRatioWidth / mRatioHeight) {
            setMeasuredDimension(width, width * mRatioHeight / mRatioWidth);
        } else {
            setMeasuredDimension(height * mRatioWidth / mRatioHeight, height);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I attempted to correct this by setting the correct heights and widths in <code>setMeasuredDimension(width, height);</code>, this fixed the height issue and gave me a full screen preview from the textureview, however the aspect ratio is completely broken and warped on every device, what is the standard way of fixing this? I see many apps on the play store have found a way to solve this problem but havent been able to track down a fix, any help will go a long way, thanks.</p>

"Preventing adjacent/overlapping entries with EXCLUDE in PostgreSQL","<p>I am creating a database which stores arbitrary date/time ranges in PostgreSQL 9.2.4. I want to place a constraint on this database which forces the date/time ranges to be non-overlapping, and non-adjacent (since two adjacent ranges can be expressed as a single continuous range).</p>

<p>To do this, I am using an <code>EXCLUDE</code> constraint with a GiST index. Here is the constraint I have currently:</p>

<pre><code>ADD CONSTRAINT overlap_exclude EXCLUDE USING GIST (
    box(
        point (
            extract(EPOCH FROM ""from"") - 1,
            extract(EPOCH FROM ""from"") - 1
        ),
        point (
            extract(EPOCH FROM ""to""),
            extract(EPOCH FROM ""to"")
        )
    ) WITH &amp;&amp;
);
</code></pre>

<p>The columns <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> are both <code>TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE</code>, and are date/times stored in UTC (I convert to UTC before inserting data into these columns in my application, and I have my database's timezone set to ""UTC"" in postgresql.conf).</p>

<p>The problem I am thinking I might have, though, is that this constraint is making the (incorrect) assumption that there are no time increments smaller than one second.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that, for the particular data I am storing, I only need second resolution. However, I feel that I may still need to deal with this since the SQL types <code>timestamp</code> and <code>timestamptz</code> are both higher resolution than one second.</p>

<p>My question is either: is there any problem with simply assuming second resolution, since that's all my application needs (or wants), or, if there is, how can I alter this constraint to deal with fractions-of-a-second in a robust way?</p>

"Why doesn't inheritance work the way I think it should work?","<p>I'm having some inheritance issues as I've got a group of inter-related abstract classes that need to all be overridden together to create a client implementation.  Ideally I would like to do something like the following:</p>

}

abstract class Leg { }

class Dog : Animal
{
  public override DogLeg Leg() {...}
}

class DogLeg : Leg { }

<p>This would allow anyone using the Dog class to automatically get DogLegs and anyone using the Animal class to get Legs.  The problem is that the overridden function has to have the same type as the base class so this will not compile. I don't see why it shouldn't though, since DogLeg is implicitly castable to Leg.  I know there are plenty of ways around this, but I'm more curious why this isn't possible/implemented in C#.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I modified this somewhat, since I'm actually using properties instead of functions in my code.  </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I changed it back to functions, because the answer only applies to that situation (covariance on the value parameter of a property's set function <strong>shouldn't</strong> work).  Sorry for the fluctuations!  I realize it makes a lot of the answers seem irrelevant.</p>

<p>If there's a free library out there that does this in a reliable, cross-platform manner, that would be great (even if it makes external calls or uses native code itself).</p>

<p>Any suggestions are much appreciated.</p>

<p>To clarify, I would like to get the current CPU usage for the whole system, not just the Java process(es).</p>

<p>The SIGAR API provides all the functionality I'm looking for in one package, so it's the best answer to my question so far. However, due it being licensed under the GPL, I cannot use it for my original purpose (a closed source, commercial product). It's possible that Hyperic may license SIGAR for commercial use, but I haven't looked into it. For my GPL projects, I will definitely consider SIGAR in the future.</p>

<p>For my current needs, I'm leaning towards the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>For CPU usage, <code>OperatingSystemMXBean.getSystemLoadAverage() / OperatingSystemMXBean.getAvailableProcessors()</code> (load average per cpu)</li>
<li>For memory, <code>OperatingSystemMXBean.getTotalPhysicalMemorySize()</code> and <code>OperatingSystemMXBean.getFreePhysicalMemorySize()</code></li>
<li>For disk space, <code>File.getTotalSpace()</code> and <code>File.getUsableSpace()</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Limitations:</p>

<p>The <code>getSystemLoadAverage()</code> and disk space querying methods are only available under Java 6. Also, some JMX functionality may not be available to all platforms (i.e. it's been reported that <code>getSystemLoadAverage()</code> returns -1 on Windows).</p>

"Storing Windows passwords","<p>I'm writing (in C# with .NET 3.5) an administrative application which will poll multiple Windows systems for various bits of data. In many cases it will use WMI, but in some cases it may need to read remote registry or remotely execute some command or script on the polled system. This polling will happen at repeating intervals - usually nightly, but can be configured to happen more (or less) frequently. So the poll could happen as often as every 10 minutes or as rarely as once a month. It needs to happen in an automated way, without any human intervention.</p>

<p>These functions will require admin-level access to the polled systems. Now, I expect that in most use cases, there will be a domain, and the polling application can run as a service with Domain Admin (or equivalent) privileges, which means I do not have to worry about storing passwords - the admin setting up the app will define the service's username/password via standard Windows mechanisms.</p>

<p>But there's always a few black sheep out there. The program may run in nondomain environments, or in cases where some polled systems are not members of the domain. In these cases we will have to define a username and password, store them securely, then invoke this user/pass pair at the time we poll that system. So keep in mind - in this case the program being written <em>is the user</em> who <em>sends</em> password to the authenticating system. </p>

<p>I am not sure whether I will need to use a reversible hash which I then decrypt to plaintext at time of use, or if there is some Windows mechanism which would allow me to store and then reuse the hash only. Obviously the second mechanism is preferable; I'd like my program to either <em>never</em> know the password's plaintext value, or know it for the shortest amount of time possible.</p>

<p>I need suggestions for smart and secure ways to accomplish this.</p>

<p>I would like some advice on how I should generate API documentation for an internal project. I am relatively new to Git and we are trying to implement some sound build/deploying practices.</p>

<p>One of the things we discussed was making sure our code base is well documented and generating documentation using something like PhpDocumentor2 or one of the many similar tools.</p>

<h2>Should I automate when the docs are built?</h2>

<p>For example a pre or post commit hook in git when tagging a release. Or should when I merge develop to a release branch just manually create the docs and commit to the repository?</p>

<h2>Is it standard practice to have docs generated for each release?</h2>

<p>I might have misunderstood the process, should a new doc release correlate with a git release/tag?</p>

<h2>Where do you store the generated docs?</h2>

<p>In the same repository? a different repository? Hosted somewhere like <a href=""https://readthedocs.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Read The Docs</a> or just internally?
The current project we are working on is only small, but we would like to roll out the process to other larger projects in the future if successful.</p>

<h2>Context</h2>

<p>The project is a Magento extension which we would like to provide API docs, unit testing, and PSR conforming code. I am lacking information on how the whole workflow integrates. PHPunit and PHPDocumentor2 are installed locally via Composer.</p>

<p>I have heard and looked at Travis Ci, but I'm not sure if Docs fall in to that category.</p>

</code></pre>
<h1>Update 2 (rewritten question)</h1>
<p>This works fine, meaning that if the XML doesn't match the definitions of XSD it will throw a meaningful exception.</p>
<p>Now, I want to retrieve information from the DOMDocument using Xpath. It works fine aswell, however, from this point on the DOMDocument is completely detached from the XSD! For example, if I have a <a href=""https://www.php.net/manual/de/class.domnode.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">DOMNode</a> I cannot know whether it is of type <a href=""https://www.w3schools.com/xml/el_simpletype.asp"" rel=""noreferrer"">simpleType</a> or type <a href=""https://www.w3schools.com/xml/el_complextype.asp"" rel=""noreferrer"">complexType</a>. I can check whether the node has child (<a href=""https://www.php.net/manual/de/domnode.haschildnodes.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">hasChild()</a>) nodes, but this is not the same. Also, there is tons of information more in the XSD (like, min and max number of occurrence, etc).</p>
<p>The question really is, do I have to query the XSD myself or is there a programmatic way of asking those kind of questions. I.e. is this <a href=""https://www.php.net/manual/de/class.domnode.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">DOMNode</a> a complex or simple type?</p>
<p>In <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6524157/selecting-nodes-in-xsd-schema-using-xpath"">another post</a> it was suggested &quot;to process the schema using a real schema processor, and then use its API to ask questions about the contents of the schema&quot;. Does XPath has an API to retrieve information of the XSD or is there a different convenient way with DOMDocument?</p>
<h2>For the record, the original question</h2>
<p><s>Now, I wanted to proceed to parse information from the DOMDocument using XPath. To increase the integrity of my data I'm storing to a database and giving meaningful error message to the client I wanted to constantly use the schema information to validate the queries. I.e. I wanted to validate fetched childNodes against allowed child nodes defined in the xsd. I wanted to that by using XPath on the xsd document.</p>
<p>However, I sumbled across <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6524157/selecting-nodes-in-xsd-schema-using-xpath"">this post</a>. It basically sais it is a kind of kirky way to that yourself and you should rather use a real schema processor and use its API to make the queries. If I understand that right, I'm using a real schema processor with <code>schemaValidate</code>, but what is meant by using its API?</p>
<p>I kind of guessed already I'm not using the schema in a correct way, but I have no idea how to research a proper usage.</p>
<h1>The question</h1>
<p>If I use <code>schemaValidate</code> on the DOMDocument is that a one-time validation (true or false) or is it tied to the DOMDocument for longer then? Precisely, can I use the validation also for adding nodes somehow or can I use it to select nodes I'm interested in as suggested by the referenced SO post?</p>
<h1>Update</h1>
<p>The question was rated unclear, so I want to try again. Say I would like to add a node or edit a node value. Can I use the schema provided in the xsd so that I can validate the user input? Originally, in order to do that I wanted to query the xsd manually with another XPath instance to get the specs for a certain node. But as suggested in the linked article this is not best practice. So the question would be, does the DOM lib offer any API to make such a validation?</p>
<p>Maybe I'm overthinking it. Maybe I just add the node and run the validation again and see where/why it breaks? In that case, the answer of the custom error handling would be correct. Can you confirm?</s></p>

"Which Desktop Virtualization software runs most smoothly?","<p><strong><em>Background:</em></strong> 
I'm running a full-time job and a part-time job in the weekends, and both my employers have supplied a laptop for me to work on. Of course I also have my powerful workstation at home to work from, and sometimes when I'm at the office at my weekend job (it's in another city) I'm working from yet another workstation.</p>

<p><strong><em>Problem:</em></strong>
That makes a full 4 PC's I'm maintaining (software versions, licences and settings) just to do my work, and believe me, my list of prefered software is way too big.</p>

<p>I want to setup a Virtual Desktop on my VMware server, so I can work from the same installation and same session no matter which PC I'm working from.</p>

<p>Now I don't have the time and money to go through a full test of each setup, so I'd like to hear your experiences on the subject.</p>

<p><strong><em>Question:</em></strong>
Should I use a VMware virtual workstation with some remote logon software (like <a href=""http://www.realvnc.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">realVNC</a>, <a href=""http://www.teamviewer.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">teamviewer</a>, <a href=""https://secure.logmein.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">logmein</a>, whatever...) or should I invest in a full VDI system like <a href=""http://www.sun.com/software/vdi/index.jsp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sun</a> or <a href=""http://www.vmware.com/products/vdi/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">VMware</a> provide?</p>

<p><strong><em>Edit:</em></strong>
I'm programming in Adobe Dreamweaver on Windows XP - but I run my servers on Debian and sometimes do quick edits in VIM too. First I intend to virtualize a WinXP with base installation, to see how it runs.</p>

<p>The problem was: I do not have the source code of the ""gsoap server"". But on the agreement in our company we use (can watch) the log from this application.

<p>Also there are a lot classes and structures with ""double"" field. So in instances of some classes I set ""...Specified = true;"". In another cases I do not set ""...Specified = true;"". After the log was fixed, I see the problem.</p>

<p>So I need set ""...Specified = true;"" in all classes. I do not know is this solution correct, because </p>

<p>1) I ask another progammers in our company, but they do not know wcf normal.</p>

<p>2) set ""...Specified = true;"", but I see in log the same message.</p>

<a href=""https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/seq2seq-signal-prediction"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/seq2seq-signal-prediction</a></p>

<hr>

<p>I try to do a sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) regression with multidimensional inputs and outputs. I tried something which yields the following loss over time: </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uNOdt.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/uNOdt.png"" alt=""Loss function over time""></a></p>

<p>The model completely fails to learn to predict a sinus cloned on every input and output dimensions, even if I try a very small learning rate. </p>

<p>The Tensorflow loss function built for RNNs seems to address the cases where we directly want to train labels or words embeddings, so I tried to compute the loss myself. Regarding that, I don't know how we should deal with the dec_inp (decoder input) variable, what I try to do seems not already done in Tensorflow, yet especially simple conceptually speaking (see title). </p>

<p>Here is the tensor graph: </p>

"Swift 5 & iOS 13 UISearchController wrong presenting and dismissing behaviour","<p>While i was updating my project to iOS 13 i faced with unusual issue.
I have logic for showing and handling some <code>UISearchController</code> actions (code below), all parts were working perfectly in iOS 11 &amp; 12.</p>

<p>My task was to add search button at navigation bar to show <code>UISearchController</code> after button action.</p>

<p>But in iOS 13, i got 2 issues:</p>

<p>Code that invokes from button action</p>

<pre><code>func showSearch() {
        let searchResultsController = LUSearchResultsViewController()...
        let searchController = UISearchController(searchResultsController: searchResultsController)
        searchController.delegate = self
        searchController.searchResultsUpdater = searchResultsController
        navigationItem.searchController = searchController
        definesPresentationContext = true
        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.1) {
            searchController.isActive = true
        }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Only one solution helps me to show search controller without any diffs from previous iOS versions.</p>

<pre><code>DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.1) {
            searchController.isActive = true
}
</code></pre>

<p>Code that works on iOS 13, on iOS 11 and 12 code works without <strong>asyncAfter</strong></p>

<p>Code that helps me to hide <code>UISearchController</code> and set navigation bar initial state <strong>in iOS 11 and 12, and not in 13</strong>. After tapping <strong>cancel</strong> on SearchBar, <code>UISearchController</code> begins to call delegate methods. </p>

<pre><code>  //MARK: UISearchControllerDelegate


    public func willDismissSearchController(_ searchController: UISearchController) {
         self.navigationItem.searchController = nil
    }
</code></pre>

<p><strong>BUT</strong></p>

<p>After setting <code>navigationItem.searchController = nil</code> <code>didPresentSearchController</code> calls twice and not only <code>UISearchController</code> dismissed, but whole <code>UIViewController</code> hierarchy right to <code>UIWindow</code>.  Or if i add <code>asyncAfter</code> here i get normal dismiss with expanded nav bar height, that i don't need.</p>

"When should I use DO CONCURRENT and when OpenMP?","<p>I am aware of <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11550432/parallelizing-fortran-2008-do-concurrent-systematically-possibly-with-openmp"">this</a> and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29928293/does-gfortran-take-advantage-of-do-concurrent"">this</a>, but I ask again as the first link is pretty old now, and the second link did not seem to reach a conclusive answer. Has any consensus developed?</p>

<p>My problem is simple:</p>

<p>I have a <code>DO</code> loop that has elements that <em>may</em> be run concurrently. Which method do I use ?</p>

<p>Below is code to generate particles on a simple cubic lattice. </p>

<ul>
<li><em>npart</em> is the number of particles</li>
<li><em>npart_edge</em> &amp; <em>npart_face</em> are that along an edge and a face, respectively</li>
<li><em>space</em> is the lattice spacing </li>
<li><em>Rx</em>, <em>Ry</em>, <em>Rz</em> are position arrays</li>
<li><em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>z</em> are temporary variables to decide positon on lattice</li>
</ul>

<p>Note the difference that x,y and z have to be arrays in the CONCURRENT case, but not so in the OpenMP case because they can be defined as being PRIVATE.</p>

<p>So do I use <code>DO CONCURRENT</code> (which, as I understand from the links above, uses SIMD) :</p>

<pre><code>DO CONCURRENT (i = 1, npart)
    x(i) = MODULO(i-1, npart_edge)
    Rx(i) = space*x(i)
    y(i) = MODULO( ( (i-1) / npart_edge ), npart_edge)
    Ry(i) = space*y(i)
    z(i) = (i-1) / npart_face
    Rz(i) = space*z(i)
END DO
</code></pre>

<p>Or do I use OpenMP?</p>

<pre><code>!$OMP PARALLEL DEFAULT(SHARED) PRIVATE(x,y,z)
!$OMP DO
DO i = 1, npart
    x = MODULO(i-1, npart_edge)
    Rx(i) = space*x
    y = MODULO( ( (i-1) / npart_edge ), npart_edge)
    Ry(i) = space*y
    z = (i-1) / npart_face
    Rz(i) = space*z
END DO
!$OMP END DO
!$OMP END PARALLEL
</code></pre>

<p>My tests:</p>

<p>Placing 64 particles in a box of side 10:</p>

<pre><code>$ ifort -qopenmp -real-size 64 omp.f90
$ ./a.out 
CPU time =  6.870000000000001E-003
Real time =  3.600000000000000E-003

$ ifort -real-size 64 concurrent.f90 
$ ./a.out 
CPU time =  6.699999999999979E-005
Real time =  0.000000000000000E+000
</code></pre>

<p>Placing 100000 particles in a box of side 100:</p>

<pre><code>$ ifort -qopenmp -real-size 64 omp.f90
$ ./a.out 
CPU time =  8.213300000000000E-002
Real time =  1.280000000000000E-002

CPU time =  2.385000000000000E-003
Real time =  2.400000000000000E-003
</code></pre>

<p>Using the <code>DO CONCURRENT</code> construct seems to be giving me at least an order of magnitude better performance. This was done on an i7-4790K. Also, the advantage of concurrency seems to decrease with increasing size.</p>

"Eclipse - How can I change a 'Project Facet' from Tomcat 6 to Tomcat 5.5?","<p>(Eclipse 3.4, Ganymede)</p>

<p>I have an existing Dynamic Web Application project in Eclipse. When I created the project, I specified 'Default configuration for Apache Tomcat v6' under the 'Configuration' drop down.</p>

<p>It's a month or 2 down the line, and I would now like to change the configuration to Tomcat 'v5.5'. (This will be the version of Tomcat on the production server.)</p>

<p>I have tried the following steps (without success):</p>

<ul>
<li>I selected <code>Targeted Runtimes</code> under the Project <code>Properties</code><br>
The <code>Tomcat v5.5</code> option was disabled and The UI displayed this message:<br>
<code>If the runtime you want to select is not displayed or is disabled you may need to uninstall one or more of the currently installed project facets.</code>  </li>
<li>I then clicked on the <code>Uninstall Facets...</code> link.<br>
Under the <code>Runtimes</code> tab, only <code>Tomcat 6</code> displayed.<br>
For <code>Dynamic Web Module</code>, I selected version <code>2.4</code> in place of <code>2.5</code>.<br>
Under the <code>Runtimes</code> tab, <code>Tomcat 5.5</code> now displayed.<br>
However, the UI now displayed this message:<br>
<code>Cannot change version of project facet Dynamic Web Module to 2.4.</code><br>
The <code>Finish</code> button was disabled - so I reached a dead-end.</li>
</ul>

<p>I CAN successfully create a NEW Project with a Tomcat v5.5 configuration. For some reason, though, it will not let me downgrade' an existing Project.</p>

<p>As a work-around, I created a new Project and copied the source files from the old Project. Nonetheless, the work-around was fairly painful and somewhat clumsy.</p>

<p>Can anyone explain how I can 'downgrade' the Project configuration from 'Tomcat 6' to 'Tomcat 5'? Or perhaps shed some light on why this happened?</p>

"VS2008 Setup Project: Shared (By All Users) Application Data Files?","<p>fellow anthropoids and lily pads and paddlewheels!</p>

<p>I'm developing a Windows desktop app in C#/.NET/WPF, using VS 2008. The app is required to install and run on Vista and XP machines. I'm working on a Setup/Windows Installer Project to install the app.</p>

<p>My app requires read/modify/write access to a SQLCE database file (.sdf) and some other database-type files related to a third-party control I'm using. These files should be shared among all users/log-ins on the PC, none of which can be required to be an Administrator. This means, of course, that the files can't go in the program's own installation directory (as such things often did before the arrival of Vista, yes, yes!).</p>

<p>I had expected the solution to be simple. <strong>Vista and XP both have shared-application-data folders intended for this purpose.</strong> (""\ProgramData"" in Vista, ""\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data"" in XP.) The .NET Environment.GetFolderPath(SpecialFolder.CommonApplicationData) call exists to find the paths to these folders on a given PC, yes, yes!</p>

<p><strong>But I can't figure out how to specify the shared-application-data folder as a target in the Setup project.</strong></p>

<p>The Setup project offers a ""Common Files"" folder, but that's intended for shared program components (not data files), is usually located under ""\Program Files,"" and has the same security restrictions anything else in ""\Program files"" does, yes, yes!</p>

<p>The Setup project offers a ""User's Application Data"" folder, but that's a per-user folder, which is exactly what I'm trying to avoid, yes, yes!</p>

<p>Is it possible to add files to the shared-app-data folder in a robust, cross-Windows-version way from a VS 2008 setup project? Can anyone tell me how?</p>

"How exactly does Ray share data to workers?","<p>There are many simple tutorials and also SO questions and answers out there which claim that Ray somehow shares data with the workers, but none of these go into the exact details of what gets shared how on which OS.</p>
<p>For example in this SO answer: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/56287012/1382437"">https://stackoverflow.com/a/56287012/1382437</a> an np array gets serialised into the shared object store and then used by several workers all accessing the same data (code copied from that answer):</p>
<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>import numpy as np
import ray

ray.init()

@ray.remote
def worker_func(data, i):
    # Do work. This function will have read-only access to
    # the data array.
    return 0

data = np.zeros(10**7)
# Store the large array in shared memory once so that it can be accessed
# by the worker tasks without creating copies.
data_id = ray.put(data)

# Run worker_func 10 times in parallel. This will not create any copies
# of the array. The tasks will run in separate processes.
result_ids = []
for i in range(10):
    result_ids.append(worker_func.remote(data_id, i))

# Get the results.
results = ray.get(result_ids)
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>ray.put(data)</code> call puts the serialised representation of the data into the shared object store and passes back a handle/id for it.</p>
<p>then when <code>worker_func.remote(data_id, i)</code> is invoked, the <code>worker_func</code> gets passed the deserialised data.</p>
<p>But what exactly happens in between? Clearly the <code>data_id</code> is used to locate the serialised version of data and deserialise it.</p>
<p><strong>Q1:</strong> When the data gets &quot;deserialised&quot; does this always create a copy of the original data? I would think yes, but I am not sure.</p>
<p>Once the data has been deserialised, it gets passed to a worker. Now, if the same data needs to get passed to another worker, there are two possibilities:</p>
<p><strong>Q2:</strong> When an object that has already been deserialised gets passed to a worker, will it be via another copy or that exact same object? If it is the exact same object, is this using the standard shared memory approach to share data between processes? On Linux this would mean copy-on-write, so does this mean that as soon as the object is written to, another copy of it is created?</p>
<p><strong>Q3:</strong> Some tutorials/answers seem to indicate that the overhead of deserialising and sharing data between workers is very different depending on the type of data (Numpy versus non-Numpy) so what are the details there? Why is numpy data shared more efficiently and is this still efficient when the client tries to write to that numpy array (which I think would always create a local copy for the process?) ?</p>

"Bursty writes to SD/USB stalling my time-critical apps on embedded Linux","<p>I'm working on an embedded Linux project that interfaces an ARM9 to a hardware video encoder chip, and writes the video out to SD card or USB stick. The software architecture involves a kernel driver that reads data into a pool of buffers, and a userland app that writes the data to a file on the mounted removable device.</p>

<p>I am finding that above a certain data rate (around 750kbyte/sec) I start to see the userland video-writing app stalling for maybe half a second, about every 5 seconds. This is enough to cause the kernel driver to run out of buffers - and even if I could increase the number of buffers, the video data has to be synchronised (ideally within 40ms) with other things that are going on in real time. Between these 5 second ""lag spikes"", the writes complete well within 40ms (as far as the app is concerned - I appreciate they're buffered by the OS)</p>

<p>I think this lag spike is to do with the way Linux is flushing data out to disk - I note that pdflush is designed to wake up every 5s, my understanding is that this would be what does the writing. As soon as the stall is over the userland app is able to quickly service and write the backlog of buffers (that didn't overflow).</p>

<p>I think the device I'm writing to has reasonable ultimate throughput: copying a 15MB file from a memory fs and waiting for sync to complete (and the usb stick's light to stop flashing) gave me a write speed of around 2.7MBytes/sec.</p>

<p>I'm looking for two kinds of clues:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How can I stop the bursty writing from stalling my app - perhaps process priorities, realtime patches, or tuning the filesystem code to write continuously rather than burstily?</p></li>
<li><p>How can I make my app(s) aware of what is going on with the filesystem in terms of write backlog and throughput to the card/stick? I have the ability to change the video bitrate in the hardware codec on the fly which would be much better than dropping frames, or imposing an artificial cap on maximum allowed bitrate.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Some more info: this is a 200MHz ARM9 currently running a Montavista 2.6.10-based kernel.</p>

<p>Updates:<ul>
<li>Mounting the filesystem SYNC causes throughput to be much too poor.
<li>The removable media is FAT/FAT32 formatted and must be as the purpose of the design is that the media can be plugged into any Windows PC and read.
<li>Regularly calling sync() or fsync() say, every second causes regular stalls and unacceptably poor throughput
<li>I am using write() and open(O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC) rather than fopen() etc.
<li>I can't immediately find anything online about the mentioned ""Linux realtime filesystems"". Links?
</ul></p>

<p>I hope this makes sense. First embedded Linux question on stackoverflow? :)</p>

"Angular2: how to use bootstrap-tagsinput properly","<p>I'm trying to use <a href=""https://github.com/bootstrap-tagsinput/bootstrap-tagsinput"">bootstrap-tagsinput</a> library in my Angular2 project. The library is installed using <code>package.json</code> file:</p>

"Managing large user databases for single-signon","<p>How would you implement a system with the following objectives:</p>

<ul>
<li>Manage authentication,
authorization for
<strong>hundreds of thousands</strong> of <em>existing users</em> currently tightly integrated with a 3rd party vendor's application (We want to bust these users out into something we manage and make our apps work against it, plus our 3rd party vendors work against it).</li>
<li>Manage profile information linked to those users</li>
<li>Must be able to be accessed from any number of web applications on just about any platform (Windows, *nix, PHP, ASP/C#, Python/Django, et cetera).</li>
</ul>

<p>Here some sample implementations:</p>

<ul>
<li>LDAP/AD Server to manage everything. Use custom schema for all profile data.  Everything can authenticate against LDAP/AD and we can store all sorts of ACLs and profile data in a custom schema.</li>
<li>Use LDAP/AD for authentication only, tie LDAP users to a most robust profile/authorization server using some sort of traditional database (MSSQL/PostgreSQL/MySQL) or document based DB (CouchDB, SimpleDB, et cetera).  Use LDAP for authorization, then hit the DB for more advanced stuff.</li>
<li>Use a traditional database (Relational or Document) for everything.</li>
</ul>

<p>Are any of these three the best? Are there other solutions which fit the objectives above and are easier to implement?</p>

<p>** I should add that almost all applications that will be authenticating against the user database will be under our control.  The lone few outsiders will be the applications we're removing the current user database from and perhaps 1 or 2 others.  Nothing so broad as to need an openID server.</p>

<p>Its also important to know that a lot of these users have had these accounts for  5-8 years and know their logins and passwords, et cetera.</p>

"How to guarantee 64-bit writes are atomic?","<p>When can 64-bit writes be guaranteed to be atomic, when programming in C on an Intel x86-based platform (in particular, an Intel-based Mac running MacOSX 10.4 using the Intel compiler)?  For example:</p>

I would like to do this without any locking, and if possible without any extra code.  My hope is that, when using a 64-bit compiler (the 64-bit Intel compiler), on an operating system capable of supporting 64-bit code (MacOSX 10.4), that these 64-bit writes will be atomic.

<p>However, in my intellisense file, I can dynamically inject UserService to get its functions like this:</p>

<pre><code>intellisense.addEventListener('statementcompletion', function (event) {
    // tried doing this, but doesn't work!
    // event.target   = {};

    var injector   = angular.injector(['ng', 'myApp']);

<p>Now, if I have a global variable (or function variable) defined as <code>UserService = {}</code> and inside my controller function I type <code>UserService.</code> I will get a pop up of all the functions in the service. But if I don't have it defined, since it is interpreted as <code>undefined</code> by intellisense, it can't show me the options even though <code>statementcompletion</code> is working (as seen in the Javascript Language Service console). </p>

<p>My question is, apart from annotating the function, is there anyway to define <code>UserService</code> as an object in the intellisense file? Defining <code>event.target = {}</code> does not work (see intellisense code above).</p>

"Emojis messing with obj-c's sizeWithFont math","<p>In a <code>UITableView</code> that needs to display a long list of chatlike conversations, often containing emojis, a size calculation error occurs.</p>

<p>My problem is, that if a string is just the right length, and I use <code>sizeWithFont</code>, I on my first measurement using <code>sizewithfont</code> get an incorrect length of the string, causing a ""linebreak"".</p>

<p>Now, over at some other stacks, some claim that <code>sizeWithFont</code> will only account for the string, not the Emoji, which for me doesn't make sense, since it gets it right ""eventually""...</p>

<p>But they propose using sizeToFit instead, so I decided to give it a go.</p>

"What does ""release sequence"" mean?","<p>I don't understand, why will be problems without <code>release sequence</code>, if we have 2 threads in the example below. We have only 2 operations on the atomic variable <code>count</code>. <code>count</code> is decremented sequently as shown in the output.</p>

<p>From <em>C++ Concurrency in Action</em> by <em>Antony Williams</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I mentioned that you could get a <code>synchronizes-with relationship</code> between a <code>store</code> to an atomic variable and a <code>load</code> of that atomic variable from another thread, even when there’s a sequence of <code>read-modify-write</code> operations between the <code>store</code> and the <code>load</code>, provided all the operations are suitably tagged. If the store is tagged with <code>memory_order_release</code>, <code>memory_order_acq_rel</code>, or <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code>, and the load is tagged with <code>memory_order_consume</code>, <code>memory_order_acquire</code>, or <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code>, and each operation in the chain loads the value written by the previous operation, then the chain of operations constitutes a <strong><em>release sequence</em></strong> and the initial store <code>synchronizes-with</code> (for <code>memory_order_acquire</code> or <code>memory_order_seq_cst</code>) or is <code>dependency-ordered-before</code> (for <code>memory_order_consume</code>) the final load. Any atomic read-modify-write operations in the chain can have any memory ordering (even <code>memory_order_relaxed</code>).</p>
  
  <p>To see what this means (release sequence) and why it’s important, consider an <code>atomic&lt;int&gt;</code> being used as a count of the number of items in a shared queue, as in the following listing.</p>
  
  <p>One way to handle things would be to have the thread that’s producingthe data store the items in a shared buffer and then do <code>count.store(number_of_items, memory_order_release)</code> <strong>#1</strong> to let the other threads know that data is available. The threads consuming the queue items might then do <code>count.fetch_sub(1,memory_ order_acquire)</code> <strong>#2</strong> to claim an item from the queue, prior to actually reading the shared buffer <strong>#4</strong>. Once the count becomes zero, there are no more items, and the thread must wait <strong>#3</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If there’s <strong>one consumer thread</strong>, this is fine; the <code>fetch_sub()</code> is a read, with <code>memory_order_acquire</code> semantics, and the store had <code>memory_order_release</code> semantics, so the store synchronizes-with the load and the thread can read the item from the buffer. </p>
  
  <p>If there are <strong>two threads</strong> reading, the second <code>fetch_sub()</code> will see the value written by the first and not the value written by the store. Without the rule about the <code>release sequence</code>, this second thread wouldn’t have a <code>happens-before relationship</code> with the first thread, and it wouldn’t be safe to read the shared buffer unless the first <code>fetch_sub()</code> also had <code>memory_order_release</code> semantics, which would introduce unnecessary synchronization between the two consumer threads. Without the <code>release sequence</code> rule or <code>memory_order_release</code> on the <code>fetch_sub</code> operations, there would be nothing to require that the stores to the <code>queue_data</code> were visible to the second consumer, and you would have a data race.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What does he mean? That both threads should see the value of <code>count</code> is <code>20</code>? But in my output <code>count</code> is sequently decremented in threads.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thankfully, the first <code>fetch_sub()</code> does participate in the release sequence, and so the <code>store()</code> synchronizes-with the second <code>fetch_sub()</code>. There’s still no synchronizes-with relationship between the two consumer threads. This is shown in figure 5.7. The dotted lines in figure 5.7 show the release sequence, and the solid lines show the <code>happens-before relationships</code>

"What is the closest thing to Slime for Scheme?","<p>I do most of my development in Common Lisp, but there are some moments when I want to switch to Scheme (while reading <em>Lisp in Small Pieces</em>, when I want to play with continuations, or when I want to do some scripting in Gauche, for example). In such situations, my main source of discomfort is that I don't have Slime (yes, you may call me an addict).</p>

<p>What is Scheme's closest counterpart to Slime? Specifically, I am most interested in:</p>

<ul>
<li>Emacs integration (this point is obvious ;))</li>
<li>Decent tab completion (ideally, c-w-c-c TAB should expand to call-with-current-continuation). It may be even symbol-table based (ie. it doesn't have to notice a function I defined in a <code>let</code> at once).</li>
<li>Function argument hints in the minibuffer (if I have typed <code>(map |)</code> (cursor position is indicated by <code>|</code>)), I'd like to see <code>(map predicate . lists)</code> in the minibuffer</li>
<li>Sending forms to the interpreter</li>
<li>Integration with a debugger.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have ordered the features by descending importance.</p>

<p>My Scheme implementations of choice are:</p>

<li>MzScheme</li>
<li>Ikarus</li>
<li>Gauche</li>
<li>Bigloo</li>
<li>Chicken</li>

"Whats the correct way, using ""init"" or ""didmove""?","<p>Language: Swift 3.0 --- IDE : Xcode 8.0 beta 2 --- Project : iOS Game (SpriteKit)</p>

<p>I create a game for iOS and i know Apple is really strict with their rules to accept the app/game. So i want to know which is the correct way to setup a game.</p>

<p>I learned from google to create a new SpriteKit Project and do the following setup :</p>

<p>In <strong>GameViewController.swift</strong> clear viewDidLoad() and add all this :</p>

<pre><code>override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    let skView = self.view as! SKView

    let scene = GameScene(size: skView.bounds.size)
    scene.scaleMode = .aspectFit

    skView.presentScene(scene)
}
</code></pre>

<p>In <strong>GameScene.swift</strong> delete everything and leave this code :</p>

<pre><code>import SpriteKit

class GameScene: SKScene {
    required init?(coder aDecoder: NSCoder) {
        super.init(coder: aDecoder)
    }

    override init(size: CGSize) {
        super.init(size: size)
        // add all the code of the game here...
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>and develop my game inside override init</strong></p>

<p>But I think thats actually wrong to start the game with init. And that the right way is to use the didMove() method. So should the code be written inside here? :</p>

<pre><code>override func didMove(to view: SKView) {
    &lt;#code#&gt;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Does anyone know which one is the correct way? And why? Also if its wrong the way i do it, can you explain me how to use didMove method?</p>

"Migrate/create HA-Singleton to jboss 7","<p>I've been using deploy-hasingleton folder in jboss as 6, this allowed me to create a singleton bean that is used to control business information requests from the cluster nodes. These methods are synchronized in order to control the concurrency between nodes (the same data cannot be in different nodes).</p>

<p>Now that I'm migrating to the Jboss 7, and since that deploy-hasingleton folder disappeared, I've been following the official examples:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.jboss.org/jdf/quickstarts/jboss-as-quickstart/cluster-ha-singleton/"" rel=""nofollow"">Cluster Link</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts/tree/jdf-2.1.0.Final/cluster-ha-singleton"" rel=""nofollow"">Cluster Link 2</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The problem is that theses examples are too trivial, and I couldn't understand where I can place the business logic methods. 
So I tried to place that logic in the SingletonService, which implements: Service, MyInterface</p>

<p>And I've modified the getValue method to the following:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
    public MyInterface getValue() throws IllegalStateException,
            IllegalArgumentException {

        return this;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>On the client side: </p>

<pre><code>@Override
    public List&lt;Long&gt; myMeth(Long arg1, int arg2) {
        LOGGER.log(""loadGroups() is called()"");
        ServiceController&lt;?&gt; service = CurrentServiceContainer.getServiceContainer().getService(
                GroupDistributorService.SINGLETON_SERVICE_NAME);

        if (service != null) {
            return ((MyInterface ) service.getValue()).getMyMethod(arg1, arg2);
        } else {
            throw new IllegalStateException(""Service '"" + GroupDistributorService.SINGLETON_SERVICE_NAME + ""' not found!"");
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I doubt that this is the correct approach. And second, this appears to work in the node that contains the master singleton service. However in other nodes, it locks when calling the singleton service, and I get a timeout.</p>

"Where should I clone into when cloning a python packages from github?","<p>Problem: the package I want to install is outdated on pip, and conda doesn't have it in the repo. So, when I install a python package from github using, </p>

<pre><code>git clone package_url 
cd package_name
python setup.py
</code></pre>

<p>should I DOWNLOAD the package from within the directory that is the directory in which conda or pip usually would install my package? For example, should I run git clone from within:</p>

<pre><code>['/Users/home/anaconda/lib/python2.7/site-packages',
'/Users/home/anaconda/lib/site-python']
</code></pre>

<p>OR, can I just run git clone, from whatever directory I happen to be in.  </p>

<p>The concern is that I download from git in something like, /Users/home/Downloads, and then, when I run the setup.py file, I would only install within the /Users/home/Downloads directory, and then when I import, I wouldn't be able to find the package.</p>

<p>Accepted answer: I can run the git clone command in terminal from within any directory. Then, I can change directory into the newly established directory for the package that I cloned, and run the setup.py script. Running the setup.py script should ""automatically install [the package] within the site-packages of whatever python [is being] used when python [is invoked]"". I hope this helps someone overly anxious about running setup.py files. </p>

"Update VERY LARGE PostgreSQL database table efficiently","<p>I have a very large database table in PostgresQL and a column like ""copied"". Every new row starts uncopied and will later be replicated to another thing by a background programm. There is an partial index on that table ""btree(ID) WHERE replicated=0"". The background programm does a select for at most 2000 entries (LIMIT 2000), works on them and then commits the changes in one transaction using 2000 prepared sql-commands.</p>

<p>Now the problem ist that I want to give the user an option to reset this replicated-value, make it all zero again.</p>

<p>An update table set replicated=0;</p>

<p>is not possible:</p>

<ul>
<li>It takes very much time</li>
<li>It duplicates the size of the tabel because of MVCC</li>
<li>It is done in one transaction: It either fails or goes through.</li>
</ul>

<p>I actually don't need transaction-features for this case: If the system goes down, it shall process only parts of it.</p>

<p>Several other problems:
Doing an </p>

<pre><code>update set replicated=0 where id &gt;10000 and id&lt;20000
</code></pre>

<p>is also bad: It does a sequential scan all over the whole table which is too slow.
If it weren't doing that, it would still be slow because it would be too many seeks.</p>

<p>What I really need is a way of going through all rows, changing them and not being bound to a giant transaction.</p>

<p>Strangely, an</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE table 
  SET replicated=0 
WHERE ID in (SELECT id from table WHERE replicated= LIMIT 10000)
</code></pre>

<p>is also slow, although it should be a good thing: Go through the table in DISK-order...</p>

<p>(Note that in that case there was also an index that covered this)</p>

<p>(An update LIMIT like Mysql is unavailable for PostgresQL)</p>

<p>BTW: The real problem is more complicated and we're talking about an embedded system here that is already deployed, so remote schema changes are difficult, but possible
It's PostgresQL 7.4 unfortunately.</p>

<p>The amount of rows I'm talking about is e.g. 90000000. The size of the databse can be several dozend gigabytes.</p>

<p>The database itself only contains 5 tables, one is a very large one.
But that is not bad design, because these embedded boxes only operate with one kind of entity, it's not an ERP-system or something like that!</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

"Using Visual Studio 2008 to Assemble, Link, Debug, and Execute MASM 6.11 Assembly Code","<p>I would like to use Visual Studio 2008 to the greatest extent possible while effectively compiling/linking/building/etc code as if all these build processes were being done by the tools provided with MASM 6.11. The exact version of MASM does not matter, so long as it's within the 6.x range, as that is what my college is using to teach 16-bit assembly.</p>

<p>I have done some research on the subject and have come to the conclusion that there are several options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Reconfigure VS to call the MASM 6.11 executables with the same flags, etc as MASM 6.11 would natively do.</li>
<li>Create intermediary batch file(s) to be called by VS to then invoke the proper commands for MASM's linker, etc.</li>
<li>Reconfigure VS's built-in build tools/rules (assembler, linker, etc) to provide an environment identical to the one used by MASM 6.11.</li>
</ol>

<p>Option (2) was brought up when I realized that the options available in VS's ""External Tools"" interface may be insufficient to correctly invoke MASM's build tools, thus a batch file to interpret VS's strict method of passing arguments might be helpful, as a lot of my learning about how to get this working involved my manually calling ML.exe, LINK.exe, etc from the command prompt.</p>

<p>Below are several links that may prove useful in answering my question. Please keep in mind that I have read them all and none are the actual solution. I can only hope my specifying MASM 6.11 doesn't prevent anyone from contributing a perhaps more generalized answer.</p>

<p>Similar method used to Option (2), but users on the thread are not contactable:<br>
<a href=""http://www.codeguru.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-284051.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.codeguru.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-284051.html</a><br>
(also, I have my doubts about the necessity of an intermediary batch file)</p>

<p>Out of date explanation to my question:<br>

<p>Probably the closest thing I've come to a definitive solution, but refers to a suite of tools from something besides MASM, also uses a batch file:<br>

<p>I apologize if my terminology for the tools used in each step of the code -> exe process is off, but since I'm trying to reproduce the entirety of steps in between completion of writing the code and generating an executable, I don't think it matters much.</p>

"Choose adapter dynamically depending on librarie(s) installed","<p>I am designing a library that has adapters that supports a wide-range of libraries. I want the library to dynamically choose which ever adapter that has the library it uses installed on the machine when importing specific classes.</p>

<p>The goal is to be able to change the library that the program depends on without having to make modifications to the code. This particular feature is for handling RabbitMQ connections, as we have had a lot of problems with <a href=""https://github.com/pika/pika"" rel=""nofollow"">pika</a>, we want to be able to change to a different library e.g. <a href=""https://github.com/celery/py-amqp"" rel=""nofollow"">pyAMPQ</a> or <a href=""https://github.com/gmr/rabbitpy/"" rel=""nofollow"">rabbitpy</a> without having to change the underlying code. </p>

<p>I was thinking of implementing something like this in the <code>__init__.py</code> file of  <code>servicelibrary.simple</code>.</p>

<pre><code>try:
    #import pika # Is pika installed?
    from servicelibrary.simple.synchronous import Publisher
    from servicelibrary.simple.synchronous import Consumer
except ImportError:
    #import ampq # Is ampq installed?
    from servicelibrary.simple.alternative import Publisher
    from servicelibrary.simple.alternative import Consumer
</code></pre>

<p>Then when the user imports the library </p>

<pre><code>from servicelibrary.simple import Publisher
</code></pre>

<p>The underlying layer looks something like this</p>

<p><strong>alternative.py</strong></p>

<pre><code>import amqp

class Publisher(object):
    ......

class Consumer(object):
     ......    
</code></pre>

<p><strong>synchronous.py</strong></p>

<pre><code>import pika

class Publisher(object):
    ......

class Consumer(object):
     ......   
</code></pre>

<p>This would automatically pick the second one when the first one is not installed.</p>

<p>Is there a better way of implementing something like this? If anyone could link a library/adapter with a similar implementation that would be helpful as well.</p>

<p><strong>[Edit]</strong> </p>

<p>What would be the cleanest way to implement something like this? In the future I would also like to be able to change the default preference. Ultimately I may just settle for using the library installed, as I can control that, but it would be a nice feature to have. </p>

<p>Alexanders suggestion is interesting, but I would like to know if there is a cleaner way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By default, Linux follows an optimistic memory allocation strategy.
  This means that when malloc() returns non-NULL there is no guarantee
  that the memory really is available. In case it turns out that the
  system is out of memory, one or more processes will be killed by the
  OOM killer.</p>

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately <code>onCleared</code> it's called when the activity is killed but not when it's put in background (""when we move away from the Activity..."", background is ""moving away"" imho ^^).<br>
And I get the following output:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; ---- Activity in Foreground
&gt; 12:41:10.195  TEST: coroutine awake
&gt; 12:41:12.215  TEST: another round trip

<p>How can I solve this?</p>

<p>1 - Move the code from <code>init</code> to a <code>suspend fun start()</code> called by the activity inside a <code>lifecycleScope.launchWhenStarted</code>?  </p>

<p>I get the same result. I thought <code>lifecycleScope</code> would cancel its child coroutines when it went to background, but I get the same Timber output with this approach. </p>

<p>2 - Change my ViewModel code to:</p>

<pre><code>private lateinit var job: Job

suspend fun startEmitting() {
    job = viewModelScope.launch {
        Timber.i(""coroutine awake"")
        while (true){
            delay(2_000)
            Timber.i(""another round trip"")
        }
    }
}
fun cancelJob(){
    if(job.isActive){
        job.cancel()
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>And, in my Activity:</p>

<pre><code>override fun onResume() {

        viewModel.startEmitting()
    }
}
override fun onPause() {
    super.onPause()
    viewModel.cancelJob()
}

<p>Well it works but isn't the <code>viewModelScope</code> purpose to manage the <code>CoroutineScope</code> for me? I hate this cancelJob logic.</p>

"Can I protect against SQL injection by escaping single-quote and surrounding user input with single-quotes?","<p>I realize that parameterized SQL queries is the optimal way to sanitize user input when building queries that contain user input, but I'm wondering what is wrong with taking user input and escaping any single quotes and surrounding the whole string with single quotes. Here's the code:</p>

<pre><code>sSanitizedInput = ""'"" &amp; Replace(sInput, ""'"", ""''"") &amp; ""'""
</code></pre>

<p>Any single-quote the user enters is replaced with double single-quotes, which eliminates the users ability to end the string, so anything else they may type, such as semicolons, percent signs, etc., will all be part of the string and not actually executed as part of the command.  </p>

<p>We are using Microsoft SQL Server 2000, for which I believe the single-quote is the only string delimiter and the only way to escape the string delimiter, so there is no way to execute anything the user types in.</p>

<p>I don't see any way to launch an SQL injection attack against this, but I realize that if this were as bulletproof as it seems to me someone else would have thought of it already and it would be common practice.  </p>

<p>What's wrong with this code? Is there a way to get an SQL injection attack past this sanitization technique?  Sample user input that exploits this technique would be very helpful.</p>

<p>I still don't know of any way to effectively launch a SQL injection attack against this code. A few people suggested that a backslash would escape one single-quote and leave the other to end the string so that the rest of the string would be executed as part of the SQL command, and I realize that this method would work to inject SQL into a MySQL database, but in SQL&nbsp;Server 2000 the only way (that I've been able to find) to escape a single-quote is with another single-quote; backslashes won't do it.</p>

<p>And unless there is a way to stop the escaping of the single-quote, none of the rest of the user input will be executed because it will all be taken as one contiguous string.</p>

<p>I understand that there are better ways to sanitize input, but I'm really more interested in learning why the method I provided above won't work. If anyone knows of any specific way to mount a SQL injection attack against this sanitization method I would love to see it.</p>

"Writing XML files using XmlTextWriter with ISO-8859-1 encoding","<p>I'm having a problem writing Norwegian characters into an XML file using C#. I have a string variable containing some Norwegian text (with letters like æøå). </p>

<p>I'm writing the XML using an XmlTextWriter, writing the contents to a MemoryStream like this:</p>

<pre><code>MemoryStream stream = new MemoryStream();
XmlTextWriter xmlTextWriter = new XmlTextWriter(stream, Encoding.GetEncoding(""ISO-8859-1""));
xmlTextWriter.Formatting = Formatting.Indented;
xmlTextWriter.WriteStartDocument(); //Start doc
</code></pre>

<p>Then I add my Norwegian text like this:</p>

<pre><code>xmlTextWriter.WriteCData(myNorwegianText);
</code></pre>

<p>Then I write the file to disk like this:</p>

<pre><code>FileStream myFile = new FileStream(myPath, FileMode.Create);
StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter(myFile);

stream.Position = 0;
StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(stream);
string content = sr.ReadToEnd();

sw.Write(content);
sw.Flush();

myFile.Flush();
myFile.Close();

<p>Now the problem is that in the file on this, all the Norwegian characters look funny.</p>

<p>I'm probably doing the above in some stupid way. Any suggestions on how to fix it?</p>

"iOS *Cell Performance: Autolayout vs Frame?","<p>I'm using Auto-layout for cells (UITableViewCell and UICollectionViewCell), but noticed a significant performance drawback when the cells are re-used and I wonder what could I do to improve it.</p>

<p>Maybe it is due to the way I create/configure cell, in my app I need to show books as cells, and different book genres have different layout, but I only have one BookCell, I re-configure constraints when the cell is created/reused for a particular Book based on the book's genre.</p>

<p>From my understanding, in my case, auto-layout <strong>should</strong> be slower than fixed frame as the steps are as follows:</p>

<p><strong>auto-layout</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>remove current constraints</li>
<li>re-add constraints depending on book's genre</li>
<li>set all labels / image views for the book</li>
</ol>

<p>I think internally at step 2 iOS will re-run the constraints solver and at step 3 will re-adjust constraints (ie re-run the solver) to satisfy all labels and image views with text and images set.</p>

<p><strong>fixed-layout</strong></p>

<p>(have a list of different frames for labels, image views, for different genre)
1. re-set all labels', image views' frames
2. set labels' text and image views' images</p>

<p>It takes me some time to convert all auto-layout cells to use fixed frames, and the things I can think of, in order to improve the performance are:</p>

<ol>
<li>duplicate the generic BookCell, and make one cell for each genre.</li>
<li>set all labels, image views, <strong>before</strong> setup constraints</li>
<li>not too sure about this, should I add auto-layout constraints in <code>updateConstraints</code> method, or in the initializer (e.g. <code>initWithTableViewCellStyle:reusableIdentifier:</code>)?</li>

<p>Unfortunately, because the StronglyTypedResourceBuilder (the .Net class which generates the code for Resources) makes resource files internal by default, I can't reference my strongly typed resources in the library from another project (ie, my UI or tests), without jumping through hoops (ie, something similar to what is described <a href=""http://www.codeproject.com/KB/dotnet/Localization.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>, or writing a public wrapper class/function).</p>

<p>I then evaulate the polynomial over a given x range, essentially I'm rendering the polynomial curve. Now here's the catch. I've done this work in one coordinate system we'll call ""data space"". Now I need to present the same curve in another coordinate space. It is easy to transform input/output to and from the coordinate spaces, but the end user is only interested in the coefficients [A,B,....,Z] since they can reconstruct the polynomial on their own. How can I present a second set of coefficients [A',B',....,Z'] which represent the same shaped curve in a different coordinate system.</p>

<p>If it helps, I'm working in 2D space. Plain old x's and y's. I also feel like this may involve multiplying the coefficients by a transformation matrix? Would it some incorporate the scale/translation factor between the coordinate systems? Would it be the inverse of this matrix? I feel like I'm headed in the right direction...</p>

"Login with AAD MSAL - Login is already in progress","<p>I have a ASP.net website, that uses MSAL to login.</p>

<p>The issue I keep having is that, whenever the user logs in, then logs out again the user is redirected to a logout page.
This page implements the <code>new Msal.UserAgentApplication(msalConfig).logout()</code> function, and redirects the user back to the login page.</p>

<p>This all works perfectly. The login page will then automatically redirect the user back to the AAD login page.</p>

<p>If the user then decides to login again, the result of <code>MyMsalObject.GetAccount()</code> returns null, and an error occurs that mentions the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ClientAuthError: Login_In_Progress: Error during login call - login is already in progress.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At first I used one js file to handle log in &amp; logout, I then realised that that probably wasn't he best solution, as it attempted a login on load.</p>

<p>So I decided to split them up into two separate JS files but this hasn't fixed my problem.</p>

<p>msalObject definition:</p>

<pre><code>var msalConfig = {
    auth: {
        clientId: ""my_client_id"",
        authority: ""my_authority_url"",
        redirectUri: ""http://localhost:port""
    },
    cache: {
        cacheLocation: ""localStorage"",
        storeAuthStateInCookie: true
    }
};

var myMSALObj = new Msal.UserAgentApplication(msalConfig);
</code></pre>

<p>login code:</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){
    if (!myMSALObj.getAccount()) {
            myMSALObj.loginRedirect(msalConfig);
            acquireTokenRedirectAndCallMSGraph();
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Some extra details.
I've now made it so that users must click on a button before being redirected to Microsoft to login.</p>

<p>The above unfortunately still applies. After logging in succesfully for the first time &amp; logging out, a secondary login attempt will not yield a value in the function <code>getaccount()</code> even though, it works perfectly the first time.</p>

<p>The error I get after I've logged in is still the same namely:</p>

<p><code>ClientAuthError: Login_In_Progress: Error during login call - login is already in progress.</code></p>

<p>Even though I just logged in..</p>

<p>Does anyone have a solution?</p>

<p>Edit 2:</p>

<p>There is a little bit of progress.. sort of, I've been able to fix the error above by changing way I log the user out.</p>

<p>The config file is now a definition within document ready &amp; I've moved the log out function in there aswell.</p>

<p>Although I now face a new challenge..</p>

<pre><code>Refused to display 'https://login.microsoftonline.com/{{}}' in a frame because it set 'X-Frame-Options' to 'deny'.
</code></pre>

<p>And im not entirely sure if this is a step forward or backwards. The reproduction scenario remains the same, you log in, then you log out &amp; back in again, when microsoft sends the user back to the login page I get the error mentioned in this edit, but I don't get this error on the 1st login attempt.</p>

"Unable to Mock Glassfish Jersey Client response object","<p>I am having problems with creating a mock Response object to use with my unit tests. I am using <code>org.glassfish.jersey.core.jersey-client</code> version 2.3.1 to implement my RESTful client and <code>mockito</code> version 1.9.5 to help me with mock objects. Here is my test's code:</p>

<pre><code>@Test

    receivedResource = this.client.getAll();

    // Then
    Assert.assertNotNull(""Request constructed correctly and response received."", receivedResource);
    Assert.assertEquals(""Resource is equal to expected."", expectedResource, receivedResource);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The problem occurs when <code>this.client.getAll();</code> is executed. Here is that method's code:</p>

<pre><code>public String getAll() throws GenericAragornException, ProcessingException{
    Response response = this.simpleClient.getAllWithResponse();

    if (response.getStatus() != 200) {
        processErrorResponse(response);
    }

    String entity = response.readEntity(String.class);

    // No errors so return entity converted to resourceType.
    return entity;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I am mocking the this.simpleClient.getAllWithResponse() method with the manually created Response. When it reaches the <code>response.readEntity(resourceListType);</code> instruction, Jersey throws the following exception: <code>java.lang.IllegalStateException - Method not supported on an outbound message.</code>.  After lots of research and debugging, it turns that, for some reason, when I create a Response using the response builder such as <code>Response.ok(expectedResource, MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON).build();</code> it creates it as an OutboundResponse instead of as an <strong>InboundResponse</strong>. The latter are the only ones permitted to use the <code>Response.readEntity()</code> method. If it is an <strong>OutboundResponse</strong>, the exception is thrown.</p>

<p>However, I could not find any way of converting the manually created response to an InboundResponse. So my tests are doomed :(. Do you guys/gals have any idea of what I can do here? I don't want to mock the Response object with Mockito because I think it could be a code smell since it violates the Law of Demeter. Sincerely I am out of ideas here.

"Weird MSC 8.0 error: ""The value of ESP was not properly saved across a function call...""","<p>We recently attempted to break apart some of our Visual Studio projects into libraries, and everything seemed to compile and build fine in a test project with one of the library projects as a dependency. However, attempting to run the application gave us the following nasty run-time error message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Run-Time Check Failure #0 - The value of ESP was not properly saved across a function call. This is usually a result of calling a function pointer declared with a different calling convention.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have never even specified calling conventions (__cdecl etc.) for our functions, leaving all the compiler switches on the default. I checked and the project settings are consistent for calling convention across the library and test projects.</p>

<p>Update: One of our devs changed the ""Basic Runtime Checks"" project setting from ""Both (/RTC1, equiv. to /RTCsu)"" to ""Default"" and the run-time vanished, leaving the program running apparently correctly. I do not trust this at all. Was this a proper solution, or a dangerous hack?</p>

"C#: Convert COMP-3 Packed Decimal to Human-Readable Value","<p>I have a series of ASCII flat files coming in from a mainframe to be processed by a C# application. A new feed has been introduced with a Packed Decimal (COMP-3) field, which needs to be converted to a numerical value.</p>

<p>What's more, the fields are being read as strings. I may have the flexibility to work around this part (i.e. a stream of some sort), but the business will give me pushback.</p>

"What is the best buffer size when using BinaryReader to read big files (>1 GB)?","<p>I'm reading binary files and here is a sample:</p>

<pre><code>public static byte[] ReadFully(Stream input)
{
    byte[] buffer = new byte[16*1024];
    int read;
    while ((read = input.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length)) &gt; 0)
    {
        ......
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously the buffer size (16*1024) has a great role in performance. I've read that it depends on the I/O technology (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_ATA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SATA</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SSD</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCSI"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SCSI</a>, etc.) and also the fragment size of the partition which file exists on it (we can define during the formatting the partition).</p>

<p>But here is the question:
<strong>Is there any formula or best practice to define the buffer size?</strong> Right now, I'm defining based on trial-and-error.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
I've tested the application on my server with different buffer sizes, and I get the best performance with 4095*256*16 (16&nbsp;MB)!!! 4096 is 4 seconds slower.</p>

"implicit operator using interfaces","<p>I have a generic class that I'm trying to implement implicit type casting for.  While it mostly works, it won't work for interface casting.  Upon further investigation, I found that there is a compiler error: ""User-defined conversion from interface"" that applies.  While I understand that this should be enforced in some cases, what I'm trying to do does seem like a legitimate case.</p>

<p>Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>public class Foo&lt;T&gt; where T : IBar
{
    private readonly T instance;

    public Foo(T instance)
    {
        this.instance = instance;
    }
    public T Instance
    {
        get { return instance; }
    }
    public static implicit operator Foo&lt;T&gt;(T instance)
    {
        return new Foo&lt;T&gt;(instance);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Code to use it:</p>

<pre><code>var concreteReferenceToBar = new ConcreteBar();
IBar intefaceReferenceToBar = concreteReferenceToBar;
Foo&lt;ConcreteBar&gt; concreteFooFromConcreteBar = concreteReferenceToBar;
Foo&lt;IBar&gt; fooFromConcreteBar = concreteReferenceToBar;
Foo&lt;IBar&gt; fooFromInterfaceBar = intefaceReferenceToBar; // doesn't work
</code></pre>

<p>Does anyone know a workaround, or can anyone explain in a satisfactory way why I shuouldn't be able to cast <code>interfaceReferenceToBar</code> implicitly to <code>Foo&lt;IBar&gt;</code>, since in my case it is not being converted, but only contained within Foo?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
It looks like covariance might offer salvation.  Let's hope the C# 4.0 specification allows for implicit casting of interface types using covariance.</p>

"How to append to a select box in the WordPress customiser from an API call?","<p>I'm working on a WordPress theme and I've added a select box to allow users to select a font for their site. I figured I'd use the Google Fonts API to grab the list of fonts rather than add all 900-and-something manually, but when I call the API I'm unable to append the returned data as options in the select box.</p>

<p>This is the PHP code for my select box class: </p>

<pre class=""lang-php prettyprint-override""><code>    class Customize_Select_Control extends WP_Customize_Control {
        public $type = 'select';

        public function render_content() {
            ?&gt;
            &lt;label&gt;
                &lt;span class=""customize-control-title""&gt;&lt;?php echo esc_html( $this-&gt;label ); ?&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;select &lt;?php $this-&gt;link(); ?&gt; id=""&lt;?php echo str_replace(' ','-',strtolower(esc_html( $this-&gt;label ))); ?&gt;-select""&gt;
                    &lt;option value=""&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;value(); ?&gt;"" selected&gt;&lt;?php echo $this-&gt;value(); ?&gt;&lt;/option&gt;
                &lt;/select&gt;
            &lt;/label&gt;
            &lt;?php
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I've then added a section, setting and control to the customiser using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>    // Add Font Section
    $wp_customize-&gt;add_section( 'fonts' , array(
        'title' =&gt; __( 'Font', 'wordpress' ),
        'priority' =&gt; 100,
        'description' =&gt; __( 'Pick a font for your website.', 'wordpress' )
    ) );

    // Add the setting &amp; control for the font
    $wp_customize-&gt;add_setting( 'font-select' , array(
        'default'   =&gt; 'Open Sans',
        'transport' =&gt; 'postMessage',
    ) );
    $wp_customize-&gt;add_control( new Customize_Select_Control( $wp_customize, 'font-select', array(
        'label'      =&gt; __( 'Font', 'wordpress' ),
        'section'    =&gt; 'fonts',
        'settings'   =&gt; 'font-select',
    ) ) );
</code></pre>

<p>The following code is supposed to append the options to the select box:</p>

<pre><code>     $.ajax({
        type: ""GET"",
        url: ""https://www.googleapis.com/webfonts/v1/webfonts?key=[REDACTED]&amp;sort=popularity&amp;fields=items"",
        dataType: ""json"",
        success: function (result, status, xhr){
          console.log(result.items);
          for (var i = 0; i&lt;result.items.length; i++){
            var family = result.items[i].family;
            console.log(family);
            $('#font-select').append(`&lt;option value=""${family}""&gt;${family}&lt;/option&gt;`);
          }
        },
        error: function (xhr, status, error) {
          alert(""There was an error loading the Google fonts API: "" + status + "" "" + error + "" "" + xhr.status + "" "" + xhr.statusText + ""\n\nPlease save your changes and refresh the page to try again."")
        }
      });
</code></pre>

<p>If I change <em>#font-select</em> to <em>body</em>, it appends the options just fine, but however I try and append them to the select box, it just doesn't work. Any idea why and how I can make this work?</p>

"What are the consequences of not closing database connection after an error?","<p>I have an application that is causing a lot of headaches. It's a .NET app connecting to SQL Server 2005 via a web service. The program has grid that is filled by a long running stored procedure that is prone to timing out. In the case when it does time out and a SqlException is thrown, there is no execption handling to close the connection.</p>

<p>What are the actual consequences of this condition? I think that the framework or SQL Server probably takes care of it one way or another but am not sure. </p>

<p><strong>Addition</strong>
The program always works well in the morning, but after an hour or so of use it basically stops working. The issue isn't that I don't know how to code the connection properly. I need to know if these symptoms could be casued by the unclosed connections. It is kind of a big deal to change the production code and I would like to know that it is at least possible for this to be the issue.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>
I engineered this failure to occur on hundreds of simultaneous connections. Never was I able reproduce the failure condition in the application environment. Marked best practices answer as correct. Thanks everyone.</p>

"Windows C++ dialog resizer class","<p>I'm looking for a really good dialog resizer class that will stretch and shrink individual items as needed as the screen is resized.  Stephan Keil has a good one (DlgResizeHelper) which basically resizes everything by a set ratio, but I'm looking for something smarter.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Icons should not resize</p></li>
<li><p>Single-line text boxes should not be stretched vertically</p></li>
<li><p>Buttons should probably stay the same size</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Basically I'm looking for something to look at all of the controls, figure out that a static text field is related to a control next/below it and anchor the two together, and resize large controls in a 'smart' way so it looks good.</p>

<p>Are there such frameworks out there?  I've been working on one but something ready-made would probably be better.</p>

<p>FOLLOW UP: I'm looking at the suggested solutions.  Many of them require you to go in an anchor each control on the dialog.  I'm looking for something smart that will figure out what the anchors ought to be, with the ability to manually anchor if the guesses are wrong.  Seems like it should be possible -- most humans would agree a static text field next to an edit field should be anchored together.  Guess I'm almost looking for a little AI here :)</p>

Conversely, languages like Java and C# run on top of a virtual machine which abstracts away the native architecture.

"Where Linux Kernel Setup GDT","<p>I am reading through Linux Kernel code.
I have some doubt regarding GDT(Global Descriptor Table) in Linux.</p>

<p>My <strong>Questions</strong> are:</p>

<pre><code>Where Linux Kernel Setup Large GDT?
I know that in pm.c [http://lxr.free-electrons.com/source/arch/x86/boot/pm.c#L123] 
kernel call function setup_gdt() and it set up a small GDT with only three entries. 

Then jumps to protected mode code.
Then where is the code to setup large GDT with 32 entries 

( One specified in Understanding Linux Kernel  https://books.google.co.in/books?id=h0lltXyJ8aIC&amp;pg=PT59&amp;lpg=PT59&amp;dq=linux+kernel+file+gdt&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gO0lH05fHX&amp;sig=h4X1I6TP_P7JlEwzoCkQk3uztjw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XFwPVM-WBbOBsQTtiIDIDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=linux%20kernel%20file%20gdt&amp;f=false  )

My demo window is 800x600 and I am launching 1 thread per pixel. I am performing 2D texture modifications - nothing too heavy.</p>

<p>My first try was to specify </p>

<pre><code>[numthreads(32,32,1)]

<p>My Dispatch() calls are always </p>

<pre><code>Dispatch(ceil(screenWidth/numThreads.x),ceil(screenHeight/numThreads.y),1)

Toying with the Y thread group number [numthreads(16,8,1)] managed to push it to 32 fps.</p>

<p>My question is is there an optimal way to determine the thread number so I can utilize the GPU most effectively or is the just good ol' trial and error?</p>

<p>but the generated url will contain the following value for the operating system :-</p>

<pre><code>osName=Microsoft%u00ae+Windows+Server%u00ae+2008+Standard

<p>so the UriBuilder will encode the registered sign as <code>%u00ae+</code> which is wrong since when i try to decode the <code>%u00ae+</code> using online site such as <a href=""http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/</a> it will not decode <code>%u00ae+</code> as register sign ??? so can anyone adivce on this please, how i can send the registered sign inside my url  ? is this a problem within UrilBuilder ?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

This will clearly state my problem..
now i pass the asset name valueas £ ££££££
now the query[""assetName""] will get the correct value.. but inside the query the value will get encoded wrongly (will not be encoded using UTF8 )!!!</p>

"Slow SoapHttpClientProtocol constructor","<p>I'm doing some experiments with Microsoft Dynamics CRM. You interact with it through web services and I have added a Web Reference to my project. The web service interface is very rich, and the generated ""Reference.cs"" is some 90k loc. </p>

<p>I'm using the web reference in a console application. I often change something, recompile and run. Compilation is fast, but newing up the web service reference is very slow, taking some 15-20 seconds:
<code>
    CrmService service = new CrmService();
</code>
Profiling reveals that all time is spent in the SoapHttpClientProtocol constructor.</p>

<p>The culprit is apparently the fact that the XML serialization code (not included in the 90k loc mentioned above) is generated at run time, before being JIT'ed. This happens during the constructor call. The wait is rather frustrating when playing around and trying things out.</p>

<p>I've tried various combinations of sgen.exe, ngen and XGenPlus (which takes several hours and generates 500MB of additional code) but to no avail. I've considered implementing a Windows service that have few CrmService instances ready to dish out when needed but that seems excessive.</p>

"Why does Apache Tomcat handle encoded slashes (%2F) as path separators?","<p>Apache Tomcat (at least before Tomcat 6 <sup>see footnote</sup>) treats a percent-encoded slash (%2F) in a URI path just like a regular slash (i.e. as a path delimiter).</p>

<p>So e.g. the servlets example page of Tomcat can be accessed at </p>

<ul>
<li><code>http://localhost:8080/examples/servlets/</code> and at</li>
<li><code>http://localhost:8080/examples%2Fservlets/</code></li>
</ul>

<p>This does not make sense to me. The whole point of percent-encoding a reserved character like ""/"" is to avoid it being treated as a reserved character (in this case a path delimiter). In addition to this, this behaviour is (one) cause of the vulnerability <a href=""http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0450"" rel=""noreferrer"">CVE-2007-0450</a>. However, I assume there must have been a reason for this.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Is there any technical reason why Tomcat treats (ok, used to treat) %2F as a path delimiter?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there some situation where this behaviour is helpful?</p></li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Footnote: I realize that due to CVE-2007-0450 Tomcat's default behaviour was changed to reject percent-encoded slashes in the path. However, if this check is disabled (ALLOW_ENCODED_SLASH), the old behavior remains.</p>

"Linux shared library init & deinit when also using c++ static initializer","<p>I want to have automated calls to initialize and deinitialize my shared library.</p>

<p>In my shared library, I need some static initialization of C++ objects, among others because of use of third party code (e.g. UnitTest++).
When my init function is executed, I need to be guaranted, that all static initialization of C++ objects (of all linked translation units) is done (and vice versa for deinit); so just the same conditions as the execution of main() can expect in a C++ program.</p>

<p>I've seen much informations about linux shared library init/deinit e.g. like:<ul>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9759880/automatically-executed-functions-when-loading-shared-libraries"">Automatically executed functions when loading shared libraries</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1681145/how-to-initialize-a-shared-library-on-linux"">How to initialize a shared library on Linux</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO.html#INIT-AND-CLEANUP"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO.html#INIT-AND-CLEANUP</a></li>
</ul>
But the provided solutions won't fit my needs. In both approaches (<code>__attribute__((constructor))</code> and even <code>-Wl,-init,&lt;function name&gt;</code>) the init function seems to be called before static initialization of C++ objects is completely done.</p>

<p>I also played around with <code>__attribute__ ((init_priority(…)))</code> like:</p>

<pre><code>class InitAndDeinit {
public:
    InitAndDeinit() {
        // Do some initialization
    }
    ~InitAndDeinit() {
        // Do some cleanup
    }
} initAndDeinit __attribute__((init_priority(65535)));
</code></pre>

<p>But that also won't place the calls to the desired point; even with <code>__attribute__((constructor(65535)))</code>.</p>

<p>I'd tested with gcc 4.6.4, 4.7.3 and 4.8.1 (4.6.4 shows a slightly different behaviour regarding the sorting of <code>__attribute__((constructor))</code>).</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>My current workaround is to provide exported functions (lib_init() and lib_deinit()) which have to called manually by the application.</p>

"Why is there no RAII in .NET?","<p>Being primarily a C++ developer the absence of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_acquisition_is_initialization"" rel=""noreferrer"">RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)</a> in Java and .NET has always bothered me. The fact that the onus of cleaning up is moved from the class writer to its consumer (by means of <code>try finally</code> or .NET's <a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/cyrusn/archive/2005/05/10/415956.aspx"" rel=""noreferrer""><code>using</code> construct</a>) seems to be markedly inferior.</p>

<p>I see why in Java there is no support for RAII since all objects are located on the heap and the garbage collector inherently doesn't support deterministic destruction, but in .NET with the introduction of value-types (<code>struct</code>) we have the (seemingly) perfect candidate for RAII. A value type that's created on the stack has a well defined scope and C++ destructor semantics can be used. However the CLR does not permit a value-type to have a destructor.</p>

<p>My random searches found one argument that if a value-type is <a href=""http://www.csharphelp.com/archives/archive100.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">boxed</a> it falls under the jurisdiction of the garbage collector and therefore its destruction becomes non-deterministic. 
I feel that this argument isn't strong enough, the benefits of RAII are big enough to say that a value-type with a destructor cannot be boxed (or used as a class member).</p>

<p><strong>To cut a long story short my question is</strong>: are there any other reasons value types can not be used in order to introduce RAII to .NET?  (or do you think my argument about RAII's obvious advantages are flawed?)</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I must have not phrased the question clearly since the first four answers have missed the point. I <em>know</em> about <code>Finalize</code> and its non-deterministic characteristics, I know about the <code>using</code> construct and I feel these two options are inferior to RAII. <code>using</code> is one more thing the consumer of a class must remember (how many people forgot to put a <code>StreamReader</code> in a <code>using</code> block?). My question is a philosophical one about the language design, why is it the way it is and can it be improved?</p>

<p>For instance with a generic deterministically destructible value-type I can make the <code>using</code> and <code>lock</code> keywords redundant (achievable by library classes):</p>

<pre><code>    public struct Disposer&lt;T&gt; where T : IDisposable
    {
        T val;
        public Disposer(T t) { val = t; }
        public T Value { get { return val; } }
        ~Disposer()  // Currently illegal 
        {
            if (val != default(T))
                val.Dispose();
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I'm getting that joins of large tables is very expensive, but I'm not completely sure why. What does the DBMS need to do to execute a join operation, where is the bottleneck?<br>

<p>Anyway, long story short, is there a way, at runtime, to ask Ruby where a method has been defined? Something like <code>whereami( :foo )</code> that returns <code>/path/to/some/file.rb line #45</code>? In this case, telling me that it was defined in class String would be unhelpful, because it was overloaded by some library. </p>

<p>I cannot guarantee the source lives in my project, so grepping for <code>'def foo'</code> won't necessarily give me what I need, not to mention if I have <em>many</em> <code>def foo</code>'s, sometimes I don't know until runtime which one I may be using.</p>

"Pro's of databases like BigTable, SimpleDB","<p>New school datastore paradigms like Google BigTable and Amazon SimpleDB are specifically designed for scalability, among other things. Basically, disallowing joins and denormalization are the ways this is being accomplished.</p>

<p>In <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/173726/why-are-database-joins-expensive"">this</a> topic, however, the consensus seems to be that joins on large tables don't necessarilly have to be too expensive and denormalization is ""overrated"" to some extent
Why, then, do these aforementioned systems disallow joins and force everything together in a single table to achieve scalability? Is it the sheer volumes of data that needs to be stored in these systems (many terabytes)?<br>
Do the general rules for databases simply not apply to these scales?
Is it because these database types are tailored specifically towards storing many similar objects?<br>

<p>This is a two part question:</p>

<p><strong>1.) How is Map data stored?</strong>  - When you have a network of roads, how is this data generally stored?  What parts of the data are retained inorder to reproduce a map later?  Is each road stored as a series of points where it changes direction? What kind of file formats is this data stored in? Are there publically available libraries for easily parsing these files? Does anyone have specifics on how map/road data is stored/represented it would be very helpful.</p>

<p><strong>2.) Navigation/Pathing</strong> - When doing basic pathing on this map data (a la Garmin) is my assumption correct that it is converted to a directed graph?  Is each road intersection a vertex with the edge weights the distance between vertexes?  This is what I was thinking about doing so I could try some basic well known pathing algorithms and see what I get.</p>

<p>I've seen <a href=""http://www.bts.gov/publications/north_american_transportation_atlas_data/"" rel=""noreferrer"">this</a> publically available map data on the US but I'm not sure how it is represented and if it is detailed enough for me to be able to build my directed graph out of it.</p>

"How to use POSIXLY_CORRECT in grep?","<p>There is a variable <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html#index-POSIXLY_005fCORRECT"" rel=""noreferrer"">POSIXLY_CORRECT</a> in Bash</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>POSIXLY_CORRECT</p>
  
  <p>If this variable is in the environment when Bash starts, the shell
  enters POSIX mode (see Bash POSIX Mode) before reading the startup
  files, as if the --posix invocation option had been supplied. If it is
  set while the shell is running, Bash enables POSIX mode, as if the
  command</p>

<pre><code>set -o posix
</code></pre>
  
  <p>had been executed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was told that some options of <code>grep</code> are not POSIX and so I confirmed in <a href=""http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009604499/utilities/grep.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 6 for <code>grep</code></a>. So I checked the <a href=""https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">GNU grep manual</a> and found:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>grep</em> comes with a rich set of options: some from POSIX and some being GNU extensions. Long option names are always a GNU extension,
  even for options that are from POSIX specifications. Options that are
  specified by POSIX, under their short names, are explicitly marked as
  such to facilitate POSIX-portable programming. A few option names are
  provided for compatibility with older or more exotic implementations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And it also mentions:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/manual/grep.html#Environment-Variables"" rel=""noreferrer"">2.2 Environment Variables</a></p>
  
  <p>The behavior of grep is affected by the following environment variables.</p>
  
  <p><strong>POSIXLY_CORRECT</strong><br>
  If set, grep behaves as POSIX requires; otherwise, grep behaves more like other GNU programs. POSIX requires that options that follow file names must be treated as file names; by default, such options are permuted to the front of the operand list and are treated as options. Also, POSIXLY_CORRECT disables special handling of an invalid bracket expression. See invalid-bracket-expr.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Using the part <em>Long option names are always a GNU extension, even for options that are from POSIX specifications</em> I said: let's try the variable POSIXLY_CORRECT against that.</p>

<p>So I did try with something that is not POSIX:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo ""HELLO"" | grep --ignore-case 'hello'
HELLO
</code></pre>

<p>But to my surprise it also works setting it:</p>

<pre><code>$ echo ""HELLO"" | POSIXLY_CORRECT=1 grep --ignore-case 'hello'
HELLO
</code></pre>

<p>What am I doing wrong? Shouldn't a set POSIXLY_CORRECT make <code>grep</code> not recognize a long option name?</p>

<p>The same occurs if using an option (for example <code>-C</code>) that is not POSIX:</p>

<pre><code>$ POSIXLY_CORRECT=1 grep -C 2 '2' &lt;&lt;&lt; ""1
2
3""
1
2
3
</code></pre>

<p>As well as doing all the same running <code>set -o posix</code> before.</p>

"Converting Pixels to LatLng Coordinates","<p>Hello Programming World,</p>

<p>I am using the Google Maps API v3 and I have a map overlay that I need specific coordinates from.</p>

<p>In the image, I've managed to convert the two pixel coordinate sets from the top left and bottom right into latitude and longitude coordinates manually. I've found these equalities:</p>

<p><strong><i>Top Left:</i></strong><br />
(<strong>1px</strong> [x-axis], <strong>1px</strong> [y-axis]) in pixels equals...<br />
(<strong>-109.05005006119609°</strong> [Longitude], <strong>41.00062580014626°</strong> [Latitude]) in latitude/longitude</p>

<p><strong><i>Bottom Right:</i></strong><br />
(<strong>575px</strong> [x-axis], <strong>423px</strong> [y-axis]) in pixels equals...<br />
(<strong>-102.0423399657011°</strong> [Longitude], <strong>36.99314427042206°</strong> [Latitude]) in latitude/longitude</p>

<p>However, my boss later decided that he'd rather have Google Maps draw this with Google's polyline drawing class (so I need every border angle that I drew in my overlay in latitude/longitude coordinates).</p>

<p>My question is, given these two sets of coordinates, is there some sort of equation or formula that I can use so that I can find the pixel coordinate (which I already have in an image map file) and convert it to a latitude/longitude coordinate.</p>

<p>Example: Point of interest at 132px x-axis and 10px y-axis = a° Longitude and b° Latitude
Find a and b.</p>

"Which API to call in WebSphere (Liberty) for root cause of failure of login using custom user registry?","<p><strong>WebSphere (traditional)</strong>: In case of container based authentication with <code>custom user registry</code>, when the login from web application failed, we used to find
the root cause of failure by calling:</p>

<p><code>com.ibm.websphere.security.auth.WSSubject.getRootLoginException();</code></p>

<p>The above API exists in: {Server_Root_Dir}/AppServer/plugins/com.ibm.ws.runtime_x.y.z.jar</p>

<p>The decompiled source-code of the method <code>getRootLoginException()</code> is:</p>

<pre><code>public static Throwable getRootLoginException(){
   return ContextManagerFactory.getInstance().getRootException();
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>WebSphere (Liberty)</strong>: In case of container based authentication with <code>custom user registry</code>, we are not able to find
the root cause of failure of login by calling:</p>

<p><code>com.ibm.websphere.security.auth.WSSubject.getRootLoginException();</code></p>

<p>The above API exists in: {Server_Root_Dir}/lib/com.ibm.websphere.security_x.y.z.jar</p>

<p>It is because the decompiled source-code of the method <code>getRootLoginException()</code> is:</p>

<pre><code>public static Throwable getRootLoginException(){
   return null;
}
</code></pre>

<p>But in <a href=""https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.javadoc.doc/web/apidocs/com/ibm/websphere/security/auth/WSSubject.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.javadoc.doc/web/apidocs/com/ibm/websphere/security/auth/WSSubject.html</a></p>

<p>IBM claims that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>public static java.lang.Throwable getRootLoginException()</strong></p>
  
  <p>This convenient method returns the root login exception caught in the
  system login module, if one exists.</p>
  
  <p>It will extract the exception from the current thread. You will get
  what the login module sees as the root exception. This could be a
  nested exception. You may need to extract exceptions from the
  exception returned until you get the real root exception.</p>
  
  <p>Returns:
      A Throwable containing the root login exception. If a login exception did not occur, null will be returned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would like to know which API to call in WebSphere (Liberty) in order to find the root cause of failure of login.</p>

<p><strong>Why WSSubject.getRootLoginException() is needed:</strong></p>

<p>The custom implementation of <code>com.ibm.websphere.security.UserRegistry</code> requires that you validate the username and password entered by the web application user by providing your own definition of <code>checkPassword(String userSecurityName, String passwd)</code>. Please see <a href=""http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/csec_customauth.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSAW57_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.nd.doc/ae/csec_customauth.html</a></p>

<p>If the user provides incorrect information you may throw <code>PasswordCheckFailedException</code> or <code>CustomRegistryException</code> with your message. This <code>checkPassword(String userSecurityName, String passwd)</code> is  actually invoked by the WebSphere (traditional or Liberty) from JAAS <code>javax.security.auth.spi.LoginModule.login()</code> and <code>PasswordCheckFailedException</code> or <code>CustomRegistryException</code> and their  messages are wrapped and <code>javax.security.auth.login.LoginException</code> is thrown.</p>

<p>In order to provide feedback to the web application user we need to get hold of the Exception thrown from <code>javax.security.auth.spi.LoginModule.login()</code>.
The way to do this is by calling <code>com.ibm.websphere.security.auth.WSSubject.getRootLoginException()</code> from a servlet filter. This works fine in WebSphere (traditional) but not any more  in WebSphere (Liberty). The problem is that IBM has not documented this limitation anywhere.</p>

<p>Now, <a href=""http://methodsandmessages.vox.com/library/post/transcript-show-hello-world-cr.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">having first experienced Smalltalk back in 1981</a>, I don't understand these questions very well.

Using an external editor or debugger or change control manager would seem very awkward.</p>

<p>So what is it that scares you the most about not being able to edit the five-line methods in Smalltalk with your favorite editor, or use your favorite non-Smalltalk-aware change control system?</p>

<p>I'd be interested to know if anyone has any experience/recommendations for embeddable controls that could do this better than standard html/javascript/ajax code - although suggestions for Javascript frameworks that could do this are welcome too.  I'm thinking mainly of ActiveX, Flex, Java or similar controls, commercial or open source are fine.</p>

<p>The coding languages to be used and platform is still open to debate, so ASP.NET against IE or PHP/Flex against Firefox, or some other combination is fine - this will be driven by the business requirement not the platform.  </p>

<p>Functionality is of course the main driving force, but it's always useful to have nice looking eye candy so skinable and cool is a plus.  With reference to Javascript frameworks I''ve previously used Dojo and Mootools, but I'd prefer something with a bit more snap.</p>

<p>So if I do want to build that app I'll need to come up with a approach to access SOAP services from the iPhone. What would be the best approach? Any best practices? Did someone already write a library using the functionality that is present in the iPhone SDK to access SOAP services?</p>

<p><strong>Original Post:</strong></p>

<p>I've been googling this error for days but I am out of ideas. </p>

<p>The code is generated by Axis2 for a SOAP webservice based on this WSDL: <a href=""https://webservices.chargepoint.com/cp_api_4.1.wsdl"">https://webservices.chargepoint.com/cp_api_4.1.wsdl</a></p>

<p>With soapUI everything works well and I can also get some mock responses with my code from my local Tomcat server. 
When trying to connect to the web service with my Java client I always receive this error:</p>

<blockquote>

"data shuffling by sample() decreases RMSE to lower value in testingset than trainingset","<p>I have detected a peculiar effect that RMSE gets lower for the testing set than that of the training set with the <code>sample</code> function with the <code>caret</code> package. </p>

<p>My code does a common split of training and testing set:</p>

<pre><code>  set.seed(seed)
  training.index &lt;- createDataPartition(dataset[[target_label]], p = 0.8, list = FALSE)
  training.set &lt;- dataset[training.index, ]
  testing.set &lt;- dataset[-training.index, ]
</code></pre>

<p>This e.g. gives an RMSE for testing set <code>0.651</code> which is higher than training set RMSE <code>0.575</code> - as expected.</p>

<p>Following the recommendation of many sources, e.g. <a href=""http://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/443937_b6d1e8c589c248bdaa2ccbcc44ae3a1d.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>, the data should be shuffled, so I do it  before the above split:</p>

<pre><code>  # shuffle data - short version:
  set.seed(17)
  dataset &lt;- data %&gt;% nrow %&gt;% sample %&gt;% data[.,]
</code></pre>

<p>After this shuffle, the testing set RMSE gets lower <code>0.528</code> than the training set RMSE <code>0.575</code>! This finding is consistent across a number of algorithms including <code>lm, glm, knn, kknn, rf, gbm, svmLinear, svmRadial</code> etc.</p>

<p>According to my knowledge, the default of sample() is <code>replace = FALSE</code> so there can't be any data leakage into the testing set. The same observation occurs in classification (for accuracy and kappa) although the <code>createDataPartition</code> performs stratification, so any data imbalance should be handled.</p>

<p>I don't use any extraordinary configuration, just ordinary cross-validation:</p>

<pre><code>  training.configuration &lt;- trainControl(
    method = ""repeatedcv"", number = 10
    , repeats = CV.REPEATS
    , savePredictions = ""final"",
    # , returnResamp = ""all""
    )
</code></pre>

<p>What did I miss here?</p>

<p>--</p>

<h2>Update 1: Hunch about data leakage into testing set</h2>

<p>I checked the data distribution and found a potential hint for the described effect.</p>

<p>Training set distribution:</p>

<pre><code>  . Freq      prop
1 1  124 13.581599
2 2  581 63.636364
3 3  194 21.248631
4 4   14  1.533406
</code></pre>

<p>Testing set distribution <em>without</em> shuffle:</p>

<pre><code>  . Freq      prop
1 1   42 18.502203
2 2  134 59.030837
3 3   45 19.823789
4 4    6  2.643172
</code></pre>

<p>Testing set distribution <em>with</em> shuffle:</p>

<pre><code>  . Freq      prop
1 1   37 16.299559
2 2  139 61.233480
3 3   45 19.823789
4 4    6  2.643172
</code></pre>

<p>If we look at the mode (most frequent value), its proportion in the testing set with shuffle <code>61.2%</code> is closer to the training set proportion <code>63.6%</code> than without shuffle <code>59.0%</code>. </p>

<p>I don't know how to interpret this statistically by underlying theory - can anybody?</p>

<p>An intuition of mine is that the shuffling makes the stratification of the testing set distribution (implicitly performed by <code>createDataPartition()</code>) ""more stratified"" - by that I mean ""closer to the training set distribution"". This may cause the effect of data leakage into the opposite direction - into the testing set.</p>

I am trying to employ a filter operator on angular2 observable (Rxjs) inside class member.service.ts. The observable is fetched with an http request, which I process as follows:</p>

<pre><code>  getMembers (): Observable&lt;Member[]&gt; {
    var one = this.http.get(this.memberUrl)
    .map( this.extractData )
    //.filter(x =&gt; x.type==='member')
   return one
 }
</code></pre>

<p>My question is: Why would the list not render when I uncomment the line with the filter (please view the in-memory-data.service.ts) ? In my opinion the observable is in an object state after the map operator, and does not have a type property. not sure though!.</p>

"REST: how to serialize a java object to JSON in a ""shallow"" way?","<p>Suppose I have the following JPA entities:</p>

<pre><code>@Entity
public class Inner {
  @Id private Long id;
  private String name;

  // getters/setters
}

@Entity
public class Outer {
  @Id private Long id;
  private String name;
  @ManyToOne private Inner inner;

  // getters/setters
}
</code></pre>

<p>Both Spring and java EE have REST implementations with default serializers which will marshall the entities to/from JSON without further coding. But when converting <code>Outer</code> to JSON, both Spring and EE nest a full copy of <code>Inner</code> within it:</p>

<pre><code>// Outer
{
  ""id"": ""1234"",
  ""name"": ""MyOuterName"",
  ""inner"": {
    ""id"": ""4321"",
    ""name"": ""MyInnerName""
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is correct behavior but problematic for my web services, since the object graphs can get deep/complex and can contain circular references. Is there any way to configure the supplied marshaller to marshall the POJOs/entities in a ""shallow"" way instead without having to create a custom JSON serializer for each one? One custom serializer that works on all entities would be fine. I'd ideally like something like this:</p>

<pre><code>// Outer
{
  ""id"": ""1234"",
  ""name"": ""MyOuterName"",
  ""innerId"": ""4321""

"How to specify both jaxws and jaxb bindings to achieve @XmlRootElement","<p>I've inherited a project that communicates with a SOAP-based web service. I'm a total noob at this, although have been doing Java for many years and have done a good bit with <code>XML</code>.</p>

<p>We have a <code>WSDL</code> file for the service, which contains the schema at the top and all the message definition stuff below. At the core of the problem, when I try to connect to the service through our code, I get the dreaded unable to marshal type ""<em>https.api_blah_com.services.v4.Product</em>"" as an element because it is missing an <code>@XmlRootElement</code> annotation]</p>

<p>My project already has a jaxws binding file:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;jaxws:bindings wsdlLocation=""../resources/wsdl/BlahAPI.wsdl""
  xmlns:jaxws=""http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/jaxws"" xmlns:xjc=""http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/jaxb/xjc""
  xmlns:xs=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"" xmlns:jxb=""http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/jaxb""
  xmlns:wsdl=""http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/""&gt;
  &lt;jaxws:enableWrapperStyle&gt;false&lt;/jaxws:enableWrapperStyle&gt;
  &lt;jaxws:bindings  
    node=""wsdl:definitions/wsdl:types/xs:schema[@targetNamespace='https:api.blah.com/services/v4']""&gt;
    &lt;jxb:globalBindings xmlns:jxb=""http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/jaxb"" xmlns:xs=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema""&gt;
      &lt;xjc:generateElementProperty&gt;true&lt;/xjc:generateElementProperty&gt;
    &lt;/jxb:globalBindings&gt;`
  &lt;/jaxws:bindings&gt;
&lt;/jaxws:bindings&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now I've read that in order to get all my Java classes generated with <code>@XmlRootElement</code>, I need to add a <code>jaxb:globalBinding</code> turning on simple mode.</p>

<p>I've tried adding to my local copy of the <code>WSDL</code> this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;xs:annotation&gt;
  &lt;xs:appinfo&gt;
    &lt;jaxb:globalBindings&gt;
      &lt;xjc:simple /&gt;
    &lt;/jaxb:globalBindings&gt;
  &lt;/xs:appinfo&gt;
&lt;/xs:annotation&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But the <code>JAXB</code> compiler complains that it cannot honor this globalBindings customization because it's attached to a wrong place or is inconsistent with other bindings.</p>

<p>So I tried adding another bindings file, just for jaxb, like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?&gt;
&lt;jaxb:bindings version=""1.0"" xmlns:jaxb=""http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/jaxb""
  xmlns:xjc=""http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/jaxb/xjc""
  xmlns:xs=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema""&gt;
  &lt;jaxb:bindings schemaLocation=""../resources/wsdl/blah.wsdl""&gt;
    &lt;jaxb:globalBindings&gt;
      &lt;xjc:simple /&gt;
    &lt;/jaxb:globalBindings&gt;
  &lt;/jaxb:bindings&gt;
&lt;/jaxb:bindings&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But then I get an error that blah.wsdl is not part of this compilation.</p>

<p>I am so close to calling this service...I just cannot get past this one thing, and it's all new to me so I'm not sure what else to try.</p>

<p>I could split out their <code>WSDL</code> into an <code>XSD</code> and a <code>WSDL</code>? Is that required to make this work?</p>

<p>Rationale: If a customer calls to order a product and their credit card is declined on the spot you are likely to lose the sale.

You actually use that prototype when <code>extending</code> the API of input elements, so why can't I use that prototype to create an entirely new element that works in a form?</p>

"How to get the Silverlight XAP copied to the clientbin on build","<p>I am just getting started with Silverlight and have recently added a Silverlight project to an established solution.

Now I have decided to start a new ASP.NET MVC web application that will eventually replace the older (non-MVC) web site.

"Broken tab navigation in popup with WPF user control hosted inside Winforms in default AppDomain","<p>I have a WPF user control that uses a Popup. This control is a plugin and can be loaded in the main AppDomain or in a separate AppDomain, and it is hosted in a Winforms form using ElementHost. When the plugin is loaded in the main AppDomain, and the popup is opened, tabbing between the fields of the popup instead moves focus to the first control of the popup windows parent. When it is loaded in a new AppDomain, the tab behavior works as expected/desired (it cycles through the controls in the popup window).</p>

<p>I have read through many similar, but not quite the same, questions here on SO and elsewhere, but none of the suggestions have helped.</p>

<p>It appears that the tab message is getting handled in the AddInHost (which comes from my use of FrameworkElementAdapters to marshal the WPF control across domain boundaries in out-of-domain case). My ultimate goal is to implement this as a Managed Add-in Framework addin, but I have pared that WAY down to simplify the repro.</p>

<p>In case it helps to have a more complete context, I have <a href=""https://github.com/lordjeb/PluginSandbox"" rel=""noreferrer"">a git repo of the simplified repro</a></p>

<p>What can I do to make this behavior consistent?</p>

<p>So why are C-style function pointers fundamentally different from closures or lambdas? As far as I can tell it has to do with the fact that the function pointer still points to a defined (named) function as opposed to the practice of anonymously defining the function.</p>

"Howto do python command-line autocompletion but NOT only at the beginning of a string","<p>Python, through it's readline bindings allows for great command-line autocompletion (as described in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/187621/how-to-make-a-python-command-line-program-autocomplete-arbitrary-things-not-int"">here</a>).</p>

<p>But, the completion only seems to work at the beginning of strings.  If you want to match the middle or end of a string readline doesn't work.</p>

<p>I would like to autocomplete strings, in a command-line python program by matching what I type with any of the strings in a list of available strings.  </p>

<ul>
<li>A good example of the type of autocompletion I would like to have is the type that happens in GMail when you type in the To field.  If you type one of your contacts' last name, it will come up just as well as if you typed her first name.  </li>
<li>Some use of the up and down arrows or some other method to select from the matched strings may be needed (and not needed in the case of readline) and that is fine in my case.</li>
<li>My particular use case is a command-line program that sends emails.</li>
<li>Specific code examples would be very helpful.</li>
</ul>

<p>Using terminal emulators like curses would be fine.  It only has to run on linux, not Mac or Windows.</p>

<p>Here is an example:
Say I have the following three strings in a list </p>

<pre><code>['Paul Eden &lt;paul@domain.com&gt;', 
'Eden Jones &lt;ejones@domain.com&gt;', 
'Somebody Else &lt;somebody@domain.com&gt;']

"Passing List<> to SQL Stored Procedure","<p>I've often had to load multiple items to a particular record in the database. For example: a web page displays items to include for a single report, all of which are records in the database (Report is a record in the Report table, Items are records in Item table). A user is selecting items to include in a single report via a web app, and let's say they select 3 items and submit. The process will add these 3 items to this report by adding records to  a table called ReportItems (ReportId,ItemId).</p>

<p>Currently, I would do something like this in in the code:</p>

<pre><code>public void AddItemsToReport(string connStr, int Id, List&lt;int&gt; itemList)
{
    Database db = DatabaseFactory.CreateDatabase(connStr);

    string sqlCommand = ""AddItemsToReport""
    DbCommand dbCommand = db.GetStoredProcCommand(sqlCommand);

    string items = """";
    foreach (int i in itemList)
        items += string.Format(""{0}~"", i);

    if (items.Length &gt; 0)
        items = items.Substring(0, items.Length - 1);

    // Add parameters
    db.AddInParameter(dbCommand, ""ReportId"", DbType.Int32, Id);
    db.AddInParameter(dbCommand, ""Items"", DbType.String, perms);
    db.ExecuteNonQuery(dbCommand);
}
</code></pre>

<p>and this in the Stored procedure:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO ReportItem (ReportId,ItemId)
SELECT  @ReportId,
          Id
FROM     fn_GetIntTableFromList(@Items,'~')
</code></pre>

<p>Where the function returns a one column table of integers.</p>

"Maximum recursion depth exceeded, but only when using a decorator","<p>I'm writing a program to calculate Levenshtein distance in Python. I implemented memoization because I am running the algorithm recursively. My original function implemented the memoization in the function itself. Here's what it looks like:</p>

<pre><code># Memoization table mapping from a tuple of two strings to their Levenshtein distance
dp = {}

# Levenshtein distance algorithm
def lev(s, t):

  # If the strings are 0, return length of other
  if not s:
    return len(t)
  if not t:
    return len(s)

  # If the last two characters are the same, no cost. Otherwise, cost of 1
  if s[-1] is t[-1]:
    cost = 0
  else:
    cost = 1

  # Save in dictionary if never calculated before
  if not (s[:-1], t) in dp:
    dp[(s[:-1], t)] = lev(s[:-1], t)
  if not (s, t[:-1]) in dp:
    dp[(s, t[:-1])] = lev(s, t[:-1])
  if not (s[:-1], t[:-1]) in dp:
    dp[(s[:-1], t[:-1])] = lev(s[:-1], t[:-1])

  # Returns minimum chars to delete from s, t, and both
  return min(dp[(s[:-1], t)] + 1,
             dp[(s, t[:-1])] + 1,
             dp[(s[:-1], t[:-1])] + cost)
</code></pre>

<p>This works! However, I found a way to memoize <a href=""http://www.python-course.eu/python3_memoization.php"">using decorators</a>. I tried to apply this technique to my algorithm:</p>

<pre><code># Memoization table mapping from a tuple of two strings to their Levenshtein distance
def memoize(func):
  memo = {}
  def wrap(s, t):
    if (s, t) not in memo:
      memo[(s, t)] = func(s, t)
    return memo[(s, t)]
  return wrap

# Levenshtein distance algorithm
@memoize # lev = memoize(lev)
def lev(s, t):

  # If the strings are 0, return length of other
  if not s:
    return len(t)
  if not t:
    return len(s)

  # If the last two characters are the same, no cost. Otherwise, cost of 1
  if s[-1] is t[-1]:
    cost = 0
  else:
    cost = 1

  # Returns minimum chars to delete from s, t, and both
  return min(lev(s[:-1], t) + 1,
             lev(s, t[:-1]) + 1,
             lev(s[:-1], t[:-1]) + cost)
</code></pre>

<p>To me, this looks cleaner and less confusing. I thought that the two would be functionally equivalent, but when I ran the version with the decorator, I was surprised to find that I got a <code>RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded</code>.</p>

<p>What exactly am I missing? Is using the decorator not functionally equivalent? I attempted a fix by adding <code>sys.setrecursionlimit(1500)</code> and this works, but it is a hack and doesn't explain why the two function differently. </p>

<p>NOTE: I am using one paragraph of lorem ipsum as my test strings for s and t from Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>

"What is the Debian Way to automatically fetch build dependencies under Debian or Ubuntu?","<p>I recently downloaded the source tarball for a GTK application that I'd like to improve.  It uses the standard <code>./configure</code> and <code>make</code> build sequence.</p>

<p>The first time through, <code>configure</code> reported a bunch of unmet build dependencies, such as <code>libgnomeui-2.0</code>.  As I usually do, I had to manually go through and find the Debian <code>*-dev</code> package names corresponding to these dependencies... of course the names never match up quite the same, so it gets to be a real hassle.</p>

<p>So what occurred to me is... <strong>are there any helper tools to automatically install the build dependencies listed by the <code>automake</code>/<code>autoconf</code> configuration files???</strong></p>

"How to import custom file types in Typescript","<p>As a bit of a fun project, I'm making a ""framework"" for creating native web components.

"Can't detect when Windows Font Size has changed C++ MFC","<p>I'm trying to determine how I can detect when the user changes the Windows Font Size from Normal to Extra Large Fonts, the font size is selected by executing the following steps on a Windows XP machine:</p>

<ol>
<li>Right-click on the desktop and select Properties.</li>
<li>Click on the Appearance Tab.</li>
<li>Select the Font Size: Normal/Large Fonts/Extra Large Fonts</li>
</ol>

<p>My understanding is that the font size change results in a DPI change, so here is what I've tried so far.</p>

<hr>

<h2>My Goal:</h2>

<p>I want to detect when the <strong>Windows Font Size</strong> has changed from Normal to Large or Extra Large Fonts and take some actions based on that font size change.  I assume that when the Windows Font Size changes, the DPI will also change (especially when the size is Extra Large Fonts</p>

<hr>

<h2>What I've tried so far:</h2>

<p>I receive several messages including: WM_SETTINGCHANGE, WM_NCCALCSIZE, WM_NCPAINT, etc... but none of these messages are unique to the situation when the font size changes, in other words, when I receive the WM_SETTINGSCHANGE message I want to know what changed.</p>

<p>In theory when I define the OnSettingChange and Windows calls it, the lpszSection should tell me what the changing section is, and that works fine, but then I check the given section by calling SystemParametersInfo and I pass in the action SPI_GETNONCLIENTMETRICS, and I step through the debugger and I make sure that I watch the data in the returned NONCLIENTMETRICS for any font changes, but none occur.</p>

<p>Even if that didn't work, I should still be able to check the DPI when the Settings change. I really wouldn't care about the other details, every time I get the WM_SETTINGCHANGE message, I would just check the DPI and perform the actions I'm interested in performing, but I'm not able to get the system DPI either.</p>

<p>I have tried to get the DPI by invoking the method GetSystemMetrics, also for each DC:</p>

<p>Dekstop DC->GetDeviceCaps LOGPIXELSX/LOGPIXELSY
Window DC->GetDeviceCaps LOGPIXELSX/LOGPIXELSY
Current DC->GetDeviceCaps LOGPIXELSX/LOGPIXELSY</p>

<p>Even if I change the DPI in the Graphic Properties Window these values don't return anything different, they always show 96.</p>

<p>Could anybody help me figure this out please? What should I be looking for? Where should I be looking at?</p>

<pre><code>afx_msg void CMainFrame::OnSettingChange(UINT uFlags, LPCTSTR lpszSection)

        // always 96 regardless if I change the Font 
        // Size to Extra Large Fonts or keep it at Normal

        dpi_00_X = windowDC-&gt;GetDeviceCaps(LOGPIXELSX); // 96
    }

    if( desktop )
    {
        desktopDPI = ::GetDeviceCaps(desktop, LOGPIXELSY); // 96
        dpi_01_X = ::GetDeviceCaps(desktop, LOGPIXELSX); // 96

<p>The DPI always returns 96, but the settings changes DO take effect when I change the font size to Extra Large Fonts or if I change the DPI to 120 (from the graphics properties).</p>

"How to read records terminated by custom separator from file in python?","<p>I would like a way to do <code>for line in file</code> in python, where the end of line is redefined to be any string that I want.  Another way of saying that is I want to read records from file rather than lines; I want it to be equally fast and convenient to do as reading lines.</p>

<p>This is the python equivalent to setting perl's <code>$/</code> input record separator, or using <code>Scanner</code> in java.  This doesn't necessarily have to use <code>for line in file</code> (in particular, the iterator may not be a file object).  Just something equivalent which avoids reading too much data into memory.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

"Unable to cast object of type 'System.Object[]' to 'MyObject[]', what gives?","<p>Scenario:</p>

<p>I'm currently writing a layer to abstract 3 similar webservices into one useable class. Each webservice exposes a set of objects that share commonality. I have created a set of intermediary objects which exploit the commonality. However in my layer I need to convert between the web service objects and my objects.</p>

<p>I've used reflection to create the appropriate type at run time before I make the call to the web service like so:</p>

<pre><code>    public static object[] CreateProperties(Type type, IProperty[] properties)
    {
        //Empty so return null
        if (properties==null || properties.Length == 0)
            return null;

        //Check the type is allowed
        CheckPropertyTypes(""CreateProperties(Type,IProperty[])"",type);

        //Convert the array of intermediary IProperty objects into
        // the passed service type e.g. Service1.Property
        object[] result = new object[properties.Length];
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; properties.Length; i++)
        {
            IProperty fromProp = properties[i];
            object toProp = ReflectionUtility.CreateInstance(type, null);
            ServiceUtils.CopyProperties(fromProp, toProp);
            result[i] = toProp;
        }
        return result;
    }

<p>Here's my calling code, from one of my service implementations:</p>

<pre><code>Property[] props = (Property[])ObjectFactory.CreateProperties(typeof(Property), properties);
_service.SetProperties(folderItem.Path, props);
</code></pre>

<p>So each service exposes a different ""Property"" object which I hide behind my own implementation of my IProperty interface.</p>

<p>The reflection code works in unit tests producing an array of objects whose elements are of the appropriate type. But the calling code fails:</p>

"How to detect SqlServer connection leaks in a ASP.net applications?","<p>I'm currently doing some GUI testing on a ASP.net 2.0 application. 
The RDBMS is SQL Server 2005. The host is Win Server 2003 / IIS 6.0.</p>

<p>I do not have the source code of the application because it was programmed by an external company who's not releasing the code.</p>

<p>I've noticed that the application performs well when I restart IIS but after some testing, after I have opened and closed my browser for a couple of hours, the application starts to get slower and slower. I was wondering if this behaviour was due to a bad closing connection practice from the programmers : I'm suspecting an open connection leak on the database here.</p>

<p>I guess the .Net garbage collector will eventually close them but... that can take a while, no?</p>

<p>I've got SQL Server Management Studio and I do notice from the activity monitor that there are quite a few connections opened on the database.</p>

"Floating-point optimizations - guideline","<p>The majority of scientific computing problems that we need solve by implementing a particular algorithm in C/C++ demands accuracy that are much lower than double precision. For example, <code>1e-6</code>, <code>1e-7</code> accuracy covers <code>99%</code> of the cases for ODE solvers or numerical integration. Even in the rare cases when we do need higher accuracy, usually the numerical method itself fail before we can dream of reaching an accuracy that is near double precision. Example: we can't expect 1e-16 accuracy from a simple Runge–Kutta method even when solving a standard nostiff ordinary differential equation because of roundoff errors. In this case, the double precision requirement is analogous of as asking to have a better approximation of the wrong answer.</p>

<p>Then, aggressive float point optimizations seems to be a win-win situation in most cases because it makes your code faster (a lot faster!) and it does not affect the target accuracy of your particular problem. That said, it seems remarkable difficult to make sure that a particular implementation/code is stable against fp optimizations. Classical (and somewhat disturbing) example: GSL, the GNU scientific library, is not only the standard numerical library in the market but also it is a very well written library (I can't imagine myself doing a better job). However, GSL is not stable against fp optimizations. In fact, if you compile GSL with intel compiler, for example, then its internal tests will fail unless you turn on <code>-fp-model strict</code> flag which turn off fp optimizations. </p>

<p>Thus, my question is: are there general guidelines for writing code that is stable against aggressive floating point optimizations. Are these guidelines language (compiler) specific. If so, what are the C/C++ (gcc/icc) best practices?</p>

<p>Note 1: This question is not asking what are the fp optimizations flags in gcc/icc.</p>

<p>Note 2: This question is not asking about general guidelines for C/C++ optimization (like don't use virtual functions for small functions that are called a lot).</p>

<p>Note 3: This question is not asking the list of most standard fp optimizations (like x/x -> 1). </p>

<p>Note 4: I strongly believe this is NOT a subjective/off-topic question similar to the classical ""The Coolest Server Names"". If you disagree (because I am not providing a concrete example/code/problem), please flag it as community wiki. I am much more interested in the answer than gaining a few status points (not they are not important - you get the point!). </p>

"Can a C compiler rearrange stack variables?","<p>I have worked on projects for embedded systems in the past where we have rearranged the order of declaration of stack variables to decrease the size of the resulting executable.  For instance, if we had:</p>

<pre><code>void func()
{
    char c;
    int i;
    short s;
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>We would reorder this to be:</p>

<pre><code>void func()
{
    int i;
    short s;
    char c;
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Because of alignment issues the first one resulted in 12 bytes of stack space being used and the second one resulted in only 8 bytes.</p>

<p>Is this standard behavior for C compilers or just a shortcoming of the compiler we were using?  </p>

<p>It seems to me that a compiler should be able to reorder stack variables to favor smaller executable size if it wanted to.  It has been suggested to me that some aspect of the C standard prevents this, but I haven't been able to find a reputable source either way.</p>

<p>As a bonus question, does this also apply to C++ compilers?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>If the answer is yes, C/C++ compilers can rearrange stack variables, can you give an example of a compiler that definitely does this?  I'd like to see compiler documentation or something similar that backs this up.</p>

<p><strong>Edit Again</strong></p>

<p>Thanks everybody for your help.  For documentation, the best thing I've been able to find is the paper <a href=""http://mirror-fpt-telecom.fpt.net/gcc/summit/2003/Optimal%20Stack%20Slot%20Assignment.pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">Optimal Stack Slot Assignment in GCC</a>(pdf), by Naveen Sharma and Sanjiv Kumar Gupta, which was presented at the GCC summit proceedings in 2003.</p>

<p>The project in question here was using the ADS compiler for ARM development.  It is mentioned in the documentation for that compiler that ordering declarations like I've shown can improve performance, as well as stack size, because of how the ARM-Thumb architecture calculates addresses in the local stack frame.  That compiler didn't automatically rearrange locals to take advantage of this.  The paper linked here says that as of 2003 GCC also didn't rearrange the stack frame to improve locality of reference for ARM-Thumb processors, but it implies that you could.</p>

<p>I can't find anything that definitely says this was ever implemented in GCC, but I think this paper counts as proof that you're all correct.  Thanks again.</p>

"How to Unit Test a UICollectionView within a UIViewController","<p>I want to unit test a UICollectionView which is inside a UIViewController (e.g. I want to test that the UICollectionView has the number of cells that I am expecting it to have in my unit test)</p>

<p>My unit test is based on the following blog (on how to unit test a view controller):
<a href=""http://yetanotherdevelopersblog.blogspot.co.il/2012/03/how-to-test-storyboard-ios-view.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://yetanotherdevelopersblog.blogspot.co.il/2012/03/how-to-test-storyboard-ios-view.html</a></p>

<p>In the unit test I am able to get a pointer to the UICollectionView in the UIViewController which I am testing. Here is the code in my test's setUp method:</p>

<pre><code>storyboard = [UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@""MainStoryboard"" bundle:nil];
viewController = [self.storyboard instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@""MainViewController""];
[viewController performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(loadView) withObject:nil waitUntilDone:YES];
self.collectionView = viewController.collectionView
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, there are no cells in this UICollectionView (i.e. <code>self.collectionView.visibleCells.count</code> equals 0, hence I cannot access the cells and test that the data is what I am expecting it to be), although when debugging I can see that my application add those cells to the collection view.</p>

<p>What am I doing wrong?
Any tips &amp; tricks on how to unit test UICollectionView within a UIViewController?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
After Roshan's help I can now narrow down my problem. I am unit testing a UIViewController that has a UICollectionView. In my unit test I want to test that values of the cells inside CollectionView is what I am expecting it to be. But, <code>collectionView:cellForItemAtIndexPath:</code> is not being invoked on my ViewController and hence my cells doesn't exist when this is invoked as a unit test. Any idea?</p>

"Preventing Users from Working on the Same Row","<p>I have a web application at work that is similar to a ticket working system. Some users enter new issues. Other workers choose and resolve issues. All of the data is maintained in MS SQL server 2005.</p>

<p>The users working to resolve issues go to a page where they can view open issues. Because up to twenty people can be looking at this page at the same time, one potential problem I had to address was what happens if someone picks an issue that someone else picked just after their page loaded.</p>

<p>To address this, I did two things. First, the gridview displaying the issues to select uses an AJAX timer to update every second. Once an issue has been selected, it disappears one second later at most. In case they select one within this second, they get a message asking them to choose another.</p>

<p>The problem is that the AJAX part of this is sending too many updates (this is what I am assuming) and it is affecting the performance of the page and database. In addition, the updates are not performing every second. I find the timer to be unreliable when working to trigger stored procedures.</p>

<p>There has to be a better way, but I can't seem to find one. Does anyone have experience with a situation like this or have suggestions to keep multiple users from selecting the same record to maintain? I really do not want to disable the AJAX part entirely because I feel the message alone would make the application frustrating to use.</p>

"Which language would you use for the self-study of SICP?","<p>I've caught the bug to learn functional programming for real. So my
next self-study project is to work through the <a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Structure and
Interpretation of Computer Programs</a>. Unfortunately, I've never
learned Lisp, as I was not a CS major in college. </p>

<p>While SICP does not emphasize the tools for programming, doing the
exercises entails picking a Lisp-like language to use. It seems like
some implementation of <a href=""http://plt-scheme.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Scheme</a> would be the path of least
resistance. On the other hand, I hear of others who have used <a href=""http://gigamonkeys.com/book/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Common
Lisp</a> and <a href=""http://clojure.org"" rel=""noreferrer"">Clojure</a>. It seems to me that Common Lisp or Clojure would be
more likely to be used in production code, and therefore slightly
better for my resume. BTW, I fully get the argument that learning a
language is worthwhile for its own sake, but learning a language that
helps my resume is still a benefit. I'm a capitalist and an academic
about my learning.</p>

<p>If you had to self-study SICP, which language would you pick and why?
Ideally, I would like to use a language that can run on the JVM.
I can certainly work with a language where REPL works with bash
and emacs.</p>

"Cross-referencing across multiple databases","<p>I have two databases, one is an MS Access file, the other is a SQL Server database. I need to create a SELECT command that filters data from the SQL Server database based on the data in the Access database. What is the best way to accomplish this with ADO.NET?</p>

<p>Can I pull the required data from each database into two new tables. Put these in a single Dataset. Then perform another SELECT command on the Dataset to combine the data?</p>

<p>Additional Information:
The Access database is not permanent. The Access file to use is set at runtime by the user.</p>

<p>Here's a bit of background information to explain why there are two databases. My company uses a CAD program to design buildings. The program stores materials used in the CAD model in an Access database. There is one file for each model. I am writing a program that will generate costing information for each model. This is based on current material prices stored in a SQL Server database. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>My Solution</strong></p>

<p>I ended up just importing the data in the access db into a temporary table in the SQL server db. Performing all the necessary processing then removing the temporary table. It wasn't a pretty solution but it worked.</p>

"Azure emulator slow with MVC app, can take 120 seconds to register click or JSON call","<p>Using Visual Studio 2012, Azure SDK 2.1, MVC 4 on Windows 8. Behavior is consistent on Chrome, IE10, IE11, and Firefox.</p>

<p>When debugging the application locally, very often it will slow down or stop responding entirely for minutes at a time. For example, directly entering a route like <code>https://127.0.0.1:444/Controller/Method/1234</code> causes...nothing to happen.</p>

<p>Fiddler shows the HTTP request immediately, with an open tunnel to 127.0.0.1:444.</p>

<p>If I'm excessively patient, after 120-240 seconds (!), the breakpoint is hit.</p>

<p>Aborting the connection in Fiddler sometimes leaves zombie requests running; that is, using the same procedure (make the HTTP request, wait 60 seconds, abort the request in Fiddler), 60-180 seconds later the breakpoint gets hit.</p>

<p>This affects more than one application. I think it's something to do with my own configuration, but I can't figure out what settings or issues might be involved.</p>

<p>So far I've tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Turning off Windows firewall</li>
<li>Toggling the Detect Proxy setting <a href=""http://www.cloud-developer.eu/blog/2013/10/09/visual-studio-2012-horribly-slow-performance-mvc-4-website-running-azure-emulator/"">as this guy suggested</a></li>
<li>Clearing all cached browser junk</li>
<li>Stepped through views including shared views</li>
</ul>

<p>Interestingly, on that last point, sometimes after stepping through all the views...nothing happens for a minute or two before the Controller breakpoint gets hit.</p>

<p>That's a big clue, but I still don't know what I'm missing.</p>

"What Uniquely Identifies a Client Making a Request to Web API?","<p>Let's say I write a piece of code that makes an http call to a web api, something like:</p>

<p>I then give this code to two people that live in different cities and they hit my API from their respective houses (just from some browser). What information can my API get out of the http request that will allow me to tell apart person A and person B calling it? Is the IP always available? Is the MAC address ever available? What else is there? </p>

<p>How can person A pretend to be person B when calling my API? </p>

<p>Furthermore, what if person C calls my Web API from their own Web API (backend)? Will the same information be available, or what will be different? </p>

"Authorizing REST Requests","<p>I'm working on a REST service that has a few requirements:</p>

<ol>
<li>It has to be secure.</li>
<li>Users should not be able to forge requests.</li>

<p>My current proposed solution is to have a custom Authorization header that look like this (this is the same way that the amazon web services work):</p>

<pre><code>Authorization: MYAPI username:signature
</code></pre>

<p>My question is how to form the signature.  When the user logs into the service they are given a secret key which they should be able to use to sign requests.  This will stop other users submitting requests on their behalf, but will not stop them forging requests.</p>

<p>The application that will be using this service is an iPhone application, so I was thinking we could have a public key embedded in the application which we can do an additional signature with, but does this mean we'll have to have two signatures, one for the user key and one for the app key?</p>

<p>Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I'd quite like to get this right the first time.</p>
